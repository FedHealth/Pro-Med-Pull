He developed symptoms on [3 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [4 Jan 2022]. The patient is in critical condition.The 2nd case involves a 55-year-old woman living in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, who had exposure to slaughtered poultry before onset. She developed symptoms on [6 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [9 Jan 2022]. The patient is in critical condition.From 2014 to date [27 Jan 2022], 65 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms;- Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately;- Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>---[B]Date: Thu 27 Jan 2022Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]http://outbreaknewstoday.com/china-reports-two-additional-h5n6-avian-influenza-cases-in-2022/China reports 2 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6)------------------------------------------------------The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health reports closely monitoring two human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) in the Mainland.The 1st case involves a 68-year-old man living in Langzhong in Sichuan.

The patient is in critical condition.This is the 2nd and 3rd cases reported in 2022 and since 2014, 65 human cases have been reported in China.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death.--Communicated by:ProMED[According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. There has been an increase in the number of human H5N6 cases in 2021; at least 5 cases were confirmed in December 2021, and 3 more in January 2022 based on the information in the reports above.The identified exposures in nearly all cases are related to handling live poultry, and there appears to be an increase in transmission events. Is there more H5N6 avian influenza virus circulating in poultry and/or more importantly, is the virus now more easily transmissible?

The World Health Organzation has called for ""urgent"" action. A rise in the number of people infected with avian influenza in China last year [2021] has raised concern among experts, who have warned that the strain could be more infectious to humans. Two people in China have now died of bird flu; the other 3 remain in hospital.Hong Kong's health department said 5 people in Sichuan province, Zhejiang province and Guangxi autonomous region were infected with the bird flu strain in December last year [2021].One of the two who died was a 75 year old man from Luzhou in Sichuan Province. He fell ill on [1 Dec 2021] after being exposed to live domestic poultry. He was rushed to hospital 4 days later and died on [12 Dec 2021]. The other was a 54 year old man from Leshan in the same province. He became ill on [8 Dec 2021] and died 3 weeks later on [24 Dec 2021]. He too was reportedly exposed to live domestic fowl.A 51 year old woman from Hangzhou in Zhejiang province fell ill on [15 Dec 2021] after being exposed to live domestic poultry. She was taken to hospital on [18 Dec 2021] and authorities said she was in a critical condition. The other 2 cases were recorded in Liuzhou, a city in Guangxi Autonomous Region, the Hong Kong health department said. A 53 year old man with a history of exposure to dead poultry fell ill on [19 Dec 2021] and remains hospitalized in a serious condition. A 28 year old man from the same city became ill on [23 Dec 2021] and is believed to be in a critical condition. It was not immediately clear how he had become infected. Since 2014, 65 people have been infected with the H5N6 bird flu - over half of them in the past 6 months.WHO says most of the cases had been in contact with poultry and no cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed. But WHO says further investigation is ""urgent"" to understand the risk and understand the growing number of human cases.Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, previously warned: ""The increase in human cases in China this year [2021] is concerning. It is a virus that causes high mortality. ""It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (for people)... or there could be more of this virus in poultry right now and that is why more people are infected.""Warning to travellers---------------------China is the world's largest producer of poultry and the top producer of ducks, which act as a reservoir for flu viruses. Backyard farms in China are still common and many people still prefer to buy live chickens from markets. Although avian influenza viruses constantly circulate among domestic and wild birds, they rarely infect humans. But the evolution of the viruses, which have increased as poultry populations increase, is a major concern because they could turn into a virus that spreads easily between people and cause a pandemic. In November last year [2021], British health authorities issued a travel warning to China about the risk of bird flu. Dr Gavin Dabrera, consultant in acute respiratory infections at UKHSA, said: ""Anyone visiting China should avoid exposure to birds or live birds in 'wet markets' as a precautionary measure. ""We continue to encourage people to avoid touching dead or dying birds and to maintain good hand hygiene when traveling. Bird flu remains a risk in China and if travelers experience flu-like symptoms within 10 days of returning from China they should call their GP or NHS 111 and report their recent travel.""[byline: Delmary Delmar]--communicated by:ProMED[Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk of sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.

The individual is currently well and self-isolating. The risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low.""Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare, according to the UKHSA.It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low.Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is also very rare, the organisation said.The case was detected after the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) identified an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in a flock of birds.The infected birds have all been culled. As a precaution, the UKHSA swabbed the person involved and detected low levels of flu.Further lab analysis showed that the virus was the ""H5"" type found in birds.The UKHSA said that, at this point, it has not been possible to confirm that this is a H5N1 infection (the strain that is currently circulating in birds in the UK).But the UKHSA has notified the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a precaution.It said this is the first human case of this strain in the UK, although there have been cases elsewhere globally.Professor Isabel Oliver, chief scientific officer at the UKHSA, said: ""While the risk of avian flu to the general public is very low, we know that some strains do have the potential to spread to humans and that's why we have robust systems in place to detect these early and take action.""Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely.""We have followed up all of this individual's contacts and have not identified any onward spread.""In December [2021], environment secretary George Eustice revealed the UK had been hit by a record outbreak of avian flu that led to 500 000 captive birds being culled in previous months.He told MPs an avian influenza prevention zone had been declared across the UK at the start of November [2021], requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors.On Wednesday [5 Jan 2022], the World Organisation for Animal Health warned a wave of bird flu in Asia and Europe had a greater risk of spreading to humans because of a high number of variants.The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza has raised concern among governments and the poultry industry after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds and trade restrictions.""This time the situation is more difficult and more risky because we see more variants emerge, which make them harder to follow,"" director general Monique Eloit told Reuters.""Eventually the risk is that it mutates or that it mixes with a human flu virus that can be transmitted between humans then suddenly it takes on a new dimension,"" she added.Fifteen countries had reported outbreaks of bird flu in poultry between October [2021] and the end of December [2021], mostly the H5N1 strain. Italy was the worst hit in Europe with 285 outbreaks and nearly 4 million birds culled, data showed.For contacts of an infected person who have the highest risk, the UKHSA contacts them daily to see if they have developed symptoms.People are also offered anti-viral treatment after exposure to infected birds to stop the virus reproducing in their body.Swabs are also carried out on people even if they do not have symptoms.Professor Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick, said: ""This is clearly going to be big news but the key thing is that human infections with H5N1 are really rare (fewer than 1000 worldwide since 2003) and they almost always occur as a result of direct, long-term contact with poultry.""It can result in a nasty infection for the individual concerned but there has never been any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 so at present I wouldn't consider this to be a significant public health risk.""Paul Wigley, professor of avian infection and immunity at the University of Liverpool, said: ""Whilst avian influenza has the potential to be transmitted from poultry to humans, it is very rare and, as in this case, usually due to close and long-term contact with infected birds.""Avian influenza such as the H5 serotype is largely adapted to infect birds and so is very unlikely to be transmitted from person to person.""The advice given by APHA and UKHSA over contact with infected birds is sensible and should be followed. The risk of wider infection in the general public remains low.""[Byline: Michael Howie]--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[This is the first human case of avian Influenza A/H5N1 reported from the United Kingdom. In 2006, 20 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) were reported in Azerbaijan (8 cases) and Turkey (12 cases). WHO/Europe, with international partners, supported the governments of Azerbaijan and Turkey in responding to the outbreaks. No human cases have been observed in the WHO European Region since that time, despite continued surveillance for this and other zoonotic influenza viruses (https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/influenza/zoonotic-influenza/old-links/human-infection-with-influenza-ah5n1).All human cases infected with a novel influenza strain are notifiable in the EU under EU legislation and the International Health Regulations (IHR) through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) and IHR, respectively. Human infections with A(H5N1) are notifiable according to EU Decisions 2012/506/EU and 1082/2013/EU (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/zoonotic-influenza/facts/factsheet-h5n1).This event overlaps the concurrent reports of a massive outbreak of avian influenza around the Solway Firth that has killed thousands of wildfowl in recent weeks, with over 4000 barnacle goose particularly affected/died, which equates to around 10% of the entire Svalbard population of the species (Avian influenza (09): Europe (UK) wild bird, HPAI, conservation concern 20220106.8700696).The primary risk factor for human infection with avian influenza is direct or indirect exposure to infected poultry (live or dead) or wildlife, as well as contaminated environments such as live bird markets. Additional risk factors include slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings.Given the potential zoonotic risk with this new case, contingency plans for the control of avian influenza in poultry and birds should be reviewed and implemented. Public health and animal health authorities must ensure that persons at risk are sufficiently protected from infection and appropriate measures are taken to prevent widespread transmission.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health, as well as timely sharing of viruses to inform risk assessments. - Mod.UBAOther URLs:- https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-first-brit-infected-bird-25872434- https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/01/06/first-case-human-h5-type-bird-flu-found-uk-public-warned-not/- https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/first-person-infected-bird-flu-25872620- https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/first-human-infected-bird-flu-6450808- https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/first-human-uk-infected-bird-22665123- https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10375255/Now-Britain-gets-hit-BIRD-FLU-Health-chiefs-detect-strain-person-South-West-England.html- https://www.mylondon.news/news/health/breaking-human-case-bird-flu-22665952- https://www.thejournal.ie/human-case-bird-flu-england-5647532-Jan2022/- https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/person-infected-bird-flu-england-22665365- https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1545885/bird-flu-case-england-uk-health-security-agencyFor information on HPAI H5N1 in humans (cases, deaths) since 2003 (18 countries), please refer to 'Table 2: Confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1)' at https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks.Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flulike symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches), or severe respiratory illness (e.g., chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza.

It's a virus that causes high mortality,"" said Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam.Most of the cases had come into contact with poultry, and there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, said the WHO, which highlighted the rise in cases in a statement on [4 Oct 2021].It said further investigation was ""urgently"" required to understand the risk and the increase in spill over to people. Since then, a 60-year-old woman in Hunan province was admitted to hospital in a critical condition with H5N6 influenza on [13 Oct 2021], according to a Hong Kong government statement.While human H5N6 cases have been reported, no outbreaks of H5N6 have been reported in poultry in China since February 2020.China is the world's biggest poultry producer and top producer of ducks, which act as a reservoir for flu viruses.The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not be reached for comment on the rise in H5N6 human cases. However, a study published on its website last month [September 2021] said the ""increasing genetic diversity and geographical distribution of H5N6 pose a serious threat to the poultry industry and human health"".Avian influenza viruses constantly circulate in domestic and wild birds, but rarely infect people. However, the evolution of the viruses, which have increased as poultry populations grow, is a major concern because they could change into a virus that spreads easily between people and cause a pandemic.The largest number of H5N6 infections have been in southwestern Sichuan province, though cases have also been reported in neighbouring Chongqing and Guangxi, as well as Guangdong, Anhui and Hunan provinces.At least 10 were caused by viruses genetically very similar to the H5N8 virus that ravaged poultry farms across Europe last winter and also killed wild birds in China. That suggests the latest H5N6 infections in China may be a new variant.""It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (to people)...or there could be more of this virus in poultry at the moment and that's why more people are getting infected,"" said Kuiken.Four of the Sichuan cases raised poultry at home and had been in contact with dead birds, said a September [2021] report by China's CDC. Another had bought a duck from a live poultry market a week before developing symptoms.China vaccinates poultry against avian influenza but the vaccine used last year [2020] may only partially protect against emerging viruses, preventing large outbreaks but allowing the virus to keep circulating, said Filip Claes, Regional Laboratory Coordinator at the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the Food and Agriculture Organization.The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.Backyard farms in China are common and many people still prefer to buy live chickens at markets.Guilin city in Guangxi region, which had two human cases in August [2021], said last month [September 2021] it had suspended trading of live poultry in 13 urban markets and would abolish the trade within a year.[Byline: Dominique Patton]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Wed 27 Oct 2021Source: [in Chinese, machine trans., edited]https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2021-10-27/doc-iktzscyy2109486.shtmlMacau Health Bureau: A man in Yongzhou, Hunan has been infected with H5N6 avian influenza and is now in critical condition.According to the news from the Macau Special Administrative Region Government website on [27 Oct 2021], the Macau Health Bureau said that according to the latest notification from the mainland health department, Hunan Province has confirmed a case of human infection with H5N6 avian influenza.

Since it was first discovered in poultry in China in 2008, it has gradually replaced the H5N1 avian influenza as the main virus prevalent in China's poultry farms and live poultry markets.But in its natural state, the H5N6 avian influenza virus mainly infects birds, and infections in humans rarely occur. As of the end of March 2021, only 25 human infections have been reported worldwide, and all are dispersed cases.On 12 Apr [2021], the H5N6 avian flu was found in wild birds in Shenyang, a city in Northeast China's Liaoning Province, which marked the 1st confirmed cases of the flu in China this year [2021].After May 2014, H5N6 human infection cases have been reported in several places in China, including Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Jiangxi provinces, where at least 4 people have died.Experts from the Health Commission of Guangdong Province concluded that the emergence of the case was random and the risk of transmission of the virus is relatively low now.

Of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) detected in chickens in Cambodia in live bird markets (LBMs), 75% are H9N2. Whereas serosurveys indicate persons in Cambodia with poultry contact are exposed to H9N2, active human infections have not been detected.The authors conclude that ""endemic H9N2 and other AIVs in poultry remain a concern for zoonotic infection. An interdisciplinary One Health approach is warranted to curb continuing expansion and emergence. Early detection and control in animal populations, enhanced biosafety, candidate vaccines, and prompt antiviral treatment might mitigate the risks of reassortment and continued evolution that could result in H9N2 viruses with increased mammalian adaptation or human-to-human transmission potential."" - Mod.UBAThe 1st known infection by influenza A(H9N2) occurred in 1966 among turkeys in Wisconsin. This virus is currently regarded as the most widespread avian influenza virus subtype in poultry worldwide. According to OIE's criteria, spelled out in the International Manual, H9N2 is an LPAI virus (low pathogenicity avian influenza - in poultry). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is notifiable to the OIE, defined as ""an infection of poultry by any influenza A virus that has been determined as high pathogenicity in accordance with the Terrestrial Manual."" All naturally occurring HPAI strains isolated to date have been either of the H5 or H7 subtype.LPAI H9N2 is, thus, not OIE-notifiable.In addition to poultry, this virus has also been identified in wild birds, domestic mammals, and, occasionally, in humans.LPAI H9N2 causes considerable losses to the poultry industry. Since the early 1990s, vaccination against this virus has been used extensively in Asia and the Middle East using billions of inactivated vaccine doses. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED map of Siem Reap [Siemreab] Province, Cambodia: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8668826,3128]"

This is the 1st reported case of human infection of influenza A(H5N1) virus in India.The patient was a boy under 18 years of age with a recently diagnosed underlying illness in June 2021. Shortly after immunosuppressive treatment was initiated at the hospital, he presented with fever, cough, upper respiratory symptoms, and breathing difficulty on 12 Jun [2021]. His condition progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and he was mechanically ventilated but died on 12 Jul [2021]. In the past year, the boy resided with a family member who owned a butchery in Haryana state. Based on initial investigations, there were no reports of poultry sickness or deaths from a nearby poultry farm in the village where he resided. The source of infection is unknown at this time, and none of his family members have shown similar symptoms thus far.On 7 and 11 Jul 2021 respiratory samples from the patient tested positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the All India Institute of Medical Science hospital for influenza A and influenza B viruses but negative for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. On 13 Jul [2021], the samples were sent to National Institute of Virology, a WHO reference laboratory for influenza, for subtyping. Samples were tested for seasonal viruses of influenza A and influenza B, as well as avian influenza subtypes H5, H7, H9, and H10 by RT-PCR. On 15 Jul [2021], the samples tested positive for influenza A(H5N1) and influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses. Whole-genome sequencing and virus isolation is ongoing.Public health response----------------------Local and national health authorities have taken the following monitoring, prevention, and control measures:- Conducting further epidemiological investigation on the origin of infection of the case, including a multidisciplinary rapid response team (comprising public health and animal health officials) supporting the state of Haryana;- Strengthened surveillance, including enhanced monitoring of febrile cases (house-to-house surveys for fever surveillance conducted by health-care workers) within a 10 km [6.2 mi] radius of the patient's residence;- Disinfected the patient's residence and the surrounding environment;- Directed all health institutions in the district to report any suspected cases of human infection with avian influenza;- Closely traced and managed contacts of the case, including health-care workers at the medical facility where the case was provided care;- Performed risk communication activities to heighten public awareness, including for personal protective measures;- Conducted animal surveillance by the animal husbandry department.WHO risk assessment-------------------Available information and initial field investigations suggest that no additional cases have been suspected, indicating a low likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5) viruses may be reported because these viruses have been occasionally detected in poultry populations in India. The risk assessment will be reviewed as necessary, should further epidemiological or virological information become available.India has reported outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry farms every year since it was first reported in a poultry farm in Maharashtra state in February 2006. In January and February 2021, Haryana state reported an outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N8) in Panchkula district, which severely affected poultry in the area. In that outbreak, samples collected from birds from 4 poultry farms tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N8).Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.WHO advice----------The detection of this case does not change current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza. The primary risk factor for human infection with avian influenza is direct or indirect exposure to infected poultry (live or dead) or wildlife, as well as contaminated environments such as live bird markets. Additional risk factors include slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings.As at all times, the public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry or bird faeces. Hand hygiene with frequent handwashing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is recommended.Good food safety practices such as keeping cooking environments clean, separating raw and cooked food, and cooking food thoroughly should also be followed. There is no evidence to suggest that influenza A(H5), A(H7N9), or other avian influenza viruses can be transmitted to humans through properly cooked poultry. There is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that people have been infected with avian influenza by consumption of eggs or egg products. However, eggs from areas with outbreaks in poultry should not be consumed raw or partially cooked (with runny yolk).Health-care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures should use airborne precautions. Standard contact and droplet precautions and appropriate personal protective equipment should be made available and used during epidemics.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health, as well as timely sharing of viruses to inform risk assessments.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza or variant viruses, a thorough epidemiologic investigation should be conducted (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) on the history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal human-to-human transmission of the novel virus. Additionally, clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations [IHR (2005)], and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report. WHO does not recommend any specific measures for travellers and advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this event based on the currently available information.--Submitted byProMED Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[Additional resources/links are available via the source URL above.India is now the fourth country in the South Asian region that has reported a human case of avian influenza A/H5N1.

At the time, H5N1 and (LPAI) [low pathogenic avian influenza] H7N9 were the biggest avian flu threats, with H10N8 and H9N2 (which is still very much with us) pulling up the rear.While H5N1 has declined markedly since 2015, and China's massive poultry vaccination program, which began in 2017 has -- at least temporarily -- subdued H7N9, we continue to see sporadic human infections with H5N6.Unlike the novel swine variants, and recent H10N3 and H5N8 human infections -- which have been mostly mild -- avian H5N6 tends to make humans severely ill, and death has been reported in nearly half of the 32 cases to date.Last month, Sichuan Province reported their 2nd human case -- and the 3rd reported by China since the first of the year [2021] -- which followed 4 cases reported in late 2020. Today's case (#33), announced today [14 Jul 2021] by Hong Kong's CHP, makes the 8th case reported in as many months.First the CHP's statement, then I'll return with a brief postscript.CHP closely monitors human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in SichuanThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (14 July) closely monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Sichuan Province, and again urges the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.The case involves a 55-year-old man living in Bazhong City in Sichuan Province. He developed symptoms on [Wed 30 Jun 2021] and was admitted to hospital for treatment on [Sun 4 Jul 2021]. The patient is in critical condition. The patient had contact with live domestic poultry before the onset of symptoms.From 2014 to date, 32 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Mainland [China] health authorities. ""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any places with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the WHO and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel.It is worth noting that following nearly 3 relatively quiet years from mid-2017 to early 2020, avian influenza activity in China -- and around the globe -- has been rising, with HPAI H5 viruses and LPAI H9N2 leading the way.China has reported 8 H5N6 human infections since November 2020, more than a dozen mild H9N2 infections, and at least 1 H10N3 infection. In addition, Laos has reported both a human H5N1 and a human H5N6 infection since last fall.In February of 2021, Russia reported the first confirmed human infections with avian H5N8 (see https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2021/02/russian-media-reports-7-human.html), and in May [2021] the CDC Added Zoonotic Avian A/H5N8 To Their IRAT List.Given the lack of influenza surveillance and reporting from many parts of the world, it is likely that additional cases go unreported.

Clinical presentations of avian influenza in humans include eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza.

The likelihood of human infections with influenza A(H5N8) viruses has been considered to be low.It is imperative that, with these new cases, the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of animal and seasonal human influenza should continue to be implemented. Respiratory transmission occurs mainly by droplets, disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes. Short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses may occur, particularly in crowded, enclosed spaces. Hand contamination, direct inoculation of virus, exposure to infected birds or virus-contaminated materials or environments are potential sources of infection.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific, high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, and litter, and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on how to protect themselves and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Thorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new influenza A subtype with the potential to cause a pandemic (please see case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR). Evidence of illness is not required.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection, a thorough epidemiological investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted, even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map:Russia: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8426576,98]"

Many different strains of bird flu are present in China and some sporadically infect people, usually those working with poultry. There is no indication that H10N3 can spread easily in humans.The man, a resident of the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized on [28 Apr 2021] and diagnosed with H10N3 on [28 May 2021], the health commission said. It did not give details on how the man was infected. His condition is now stable and he is ready to be discharged. Investigation of his close contacts found no other cases, the NHC said. No other cases of human infection with H10N3 have been reported globally, it added. H10N3 is low pathogenic, which means it causes relatively less severe disease in poultry and is unlikely to cause a large-scale outbreak, the NHC added.The World Health Organization (WHO), in a reply to Reuters in Geneva, said: ""The source of the patient's exposure to the H10N3 virus is not known at this time, and no other cases were found in emergency surveillance among the local population. At this time, there is no indication of human-to-human transmission. As long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is not surprising, which is a vivid reminder that the threat of an influenza pandemic is persistent.""The strain is ""not a very common virus"", said Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the regional office for Asia and the Pacific. Only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, mostly in wild birds or waterfowl in Asia and some limited parts of North America, and none had been detected in chickens so far, he added.Analysing the genetic data of the virus will be necessary to determine whether it resembles older viruses or if it is a novel mix of different viruses, Claes said. There have been no significant numbers of human infections with bird flu since the H7N9 strain killed around 300 people during 2016-2017.[byline: Hallie Gu, Dominique Patton]--communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Global Public Health Intelligence NetworkDate: Tue 1 Jun 2021Source: Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), Government of Hong Kong SAR report [edited]CHP notified of a human case of avian influenza A (H10N3) in mainland ChinaUnique ID: 1009593077---------------------------------------------------------------------SummaryInformation from the National Health Commission showed that this is the 1st case of human infection with avian influenza A(H10N3) in the world.

However, pathogenicity in mammals due to H10N3 viruses remains largely unclear. H10 subtype influenza viruses have been isolated in various species of waterfowl across worldwide geographic areas for more than 50 years. The viruses remain avian receptor binding, however, some strains are highly pathogenic to chickens, even though they lack multiple basic amino acids at the hemagglutinin cleavage site. H10 viruses occasionally infect humans"" (https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34489).""Seven H10 avian influenza viruses (AIVs), H10N3 (n = 2), H10N7 (n = 1), and H10N8 (n = 4), were isolated from chickens in Zhejiang Province, Eastern China, during surveillance of AIVs in live poultry markets in 2016 and 2017. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Zhejiang H10 strains received gene segments from H10, H3, and H7 viruses from birds in East Asia"" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30302582/).""Little is known about the virus, which appears to be rare in birds, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and does not cause severe disease. Yet avian influenza viruses that have little impact on birds can be much more serious in people, such as the H7N9 strain that killed almost 300 people in China during the winter of 2016-2017. The WHO has said there had been only rare instances of person-to-person spread of the H7N9 virus.""The strain is 'not a very common virus,' and only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, according to Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the regional office for Asia and the Pacific"" (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-018-4019-z).The current risk of further infection with H10N3 can be expected to be low, with experts describing the single case as ""sporadic"". With growing surveillance of avian influenza in the human population, more infections with bird flu viruses are being picked up. As long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is hardly surprising, and continued surveillance in animals, as well as humans, is the only recourse to detect emerging novel strains quickly. - Mod.UBAAs the general term ""highly pathogenic avian influenza"" and the historical term ""fowl plague"" refer to infection with highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus, it is necessary to assess the pathogenicity of influenza A virus isolates for domestic poultry. Although all naturally occurring ""highly pathogenic avian influenza"" (HPAI) strains isolated to date have been of either the H5 or H7 subtype, most H5 or H7 isolates have been of low pathogenicity (LPAI). Such strains, in contrast with HPAI strains, do not require the application of severe control measures on poultry farms.The methods used for the determination of strain virulence for birds have evolved over recent years with a greater understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity, but still primarily involve the intravenous inoculation of a minimum of 8 susceptible 4- to 8-week-old chickens with infectious virus; strains are considered to be highly pathogenic if they cause more than 75% mortality within 10 days, or inoculation of 10 susceptible 6-week-old chickens resulting in an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of greater than 1.2. Although all the truly HPAI viruses isolated so far have been of H5 or H7 subtypes, at least 2 isolates, both of H10 subtype (H10N4 and H10N5), have been reported that would have fulfilled both the OIE and EU in vivo definitions for HPAI viruses (see Wood et al. [1] below), as they killed 7/10 and 8/10 chickens with IVPI values greater than 1.2 when the birds were inoculated intravenously. However, these viruses did not induce death or signs of disease when inoculated intranasally and did not have a haemagglutinin cleavage site sequence compatible with HPAI virus. The IVPI of the currently discussed H10N3 strain deserves to be defined and compared with the 2 mentioned H10 strains. The above is mainly based upon OIE's terrestrial manual (version adopted in May 2015).Reference1. Wood GW, Banks J, Strong I, et al.

Also, Cambodia reported a case -- also in April -- involving a 3 year old boy.While most H9N2 infections are mild, their reported incidence has risen sharply in 2021. Whether this rise is more to do with better surveillance and reporting or is propelled by increased transmission of the virus to humans, is unknown.The following update comes from the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO):""Between 23 and 29 Apr 2021, there was one new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) reported from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to WHO in the Western Pacific Region. The case is a 30 year old female from Huizhou, Guangdong Province. The case had onset of mild symptoms on 20 Apr 2021.""To date, 12 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported from China in 2021, and a total of 54 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region since December 2015.""Admittedly, the numbers we have -- as elevated as they may be of late -- are believed to be significant undercounts. Most people in China (or elsewhere) who get minor-to-moderate flu-like symptoms never bother to see a doctor or get tested.Serological studies suggest human infection is far commoner than those numbers would have us believe (see report on high seroprevalence of avian influenza H9 among poultry professionals in Pakistan in J Infect Public Health: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2018.11.009).We've covered the growing risks from the avian H9N2 virus numerous times over the years, not only as a standalone virus (see Viruses: characterization of the H9N2 avian influenza viruses currently circulating in South China https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2019/11/viruses-characterization-of-h9n2-avian.html) but also for its ability to reassort with other -- potentially more dangerous -- influenza subtypes (see Viruses: PA from recent H9N2 AIV enhances H5N1 infection in mammalian systems https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/09/viruses-pa-from-recent-h9n2-aiv.html).In December 2019, in Emerging Infectious Diseases (Novel reassortant HPAI A(H5N2) Virus in broiler chickens, Egypt https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/1/19-0570_article), we saw a new proof of concept in the field, after an HPAI H5N8 virus reassorted with an LPAI H9N2 virus, and produced a new HPAI H5N2 virus in Egyptian poultry.And a year ago the CDC added a 2nd lineage of the H9N2 virus to their IRAT (Influenza Risk Assessment Tool) short list of novel flu viruses with pandemic potential -- H9N2: avian influenza A(H9N2) Y280 lineage [A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018] virus:""Low pathogenic avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry in many countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Since the late 1990s when the 1st human infections with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus were identified, detection of this virus has been reported infrequently in humans and in swine and other mammals. In 2018, there were 7 reported human infections, most with known exposure to poultry and with the majority involving viruses of the Y280 lineage.""Summary: A risk assessment of avian influenza A(H9N2) Y280 lineage A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018 virus was conducted in July 2019. The overall IRAT risk assessment score for this virus falls into the moderate risk category. The summary average risk score for the virus to achieve sustained human-to-human transmission was 6.2. The average risk score for the virus to significantly impact public health if it were to achieve sustained human-to-human transmission was 5.9, also in the moderate range.

Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.Avian H9N2 influenza A virus has caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5 year old child in Hong Kong in 2003. The human H9N2 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/2108/03, is of purely avian origin and is closely related to some viruses circulating in poultry in the markets of Hong Kong. The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission. Since the mid-1990s, 2 lineages of H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established in domestic poultry in southern China (a 3rd lineage described in above report), Duck/HK/Y280/97 (Y280-like) and Quail/HK/G1/97 (G1-like) viruses, which are predominantly found in chickens and quail, respectively. These viruses have been sporadically introduced into humans and cause a flu-like illness. In the meantime, H9N2 influenza Y280-like viruses were also isolated from domestic pigs in Hong Kong in 1998. These findings indicate that the interspecies transmission of H9N2 influenza virus from avian to mammalian hosts continues to occur and poses a persistent threat for humans.Furthermore, the number of human infections with A/H9N2 avian influenza viruses has been higher in 2021 (13 cases including the new case from China in the above report -- and it has been only 4 months so far) compared with earlier years, which is a cause for concern and highlights the need for continuous monitoring and risk assessments of these viruses with pandemic potential. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map of Guangdong Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8345139,334.]"

To date, a total of 31 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus have been reported (30 in China and 1 in Laos).Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza.

HPAI virus (HPAIV) H5N1 was first officially reported in Africa in 2006; thereafter, this virus has spread rapidly from Nigeria to 11 other African countries. Nigeria confirmed its 1st human case of avian flu A/H5N1 in January 2007 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5682264/). Recent reported data indicate that there is co-circulation/endemicity of multiple subtypes of avian influenza viruses (H5N8, H5N6 and H9N2) in the country, which can present diagnostic challenges as well (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1757999). Influenza presents a constant example where joint activities by public health and animal health sectors vis-a-vis ""One Health"" actions are required to strengthen surveillance efforts and to contain and monitor virus spread and the emergence of novel viruses of animal and public health concern.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific high-risk tasks, such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, and litter, and cleaning of contaminated premises, should be trained on how to protect themselves and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Thorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new influenza A subtype with the potential to cause a pandemic (please see case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR). Evidence of illness is not required.For further information and details, please see:- Current technical information including monthly risk assessments at the Human-Animal Interface WHO- Case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR (2005)- International Health Regulations IHR (2005)- Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza (2011)- Terms of Reference for National Influenza Centers of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System- Mod.UBASince late December 2020, 4 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks have been reported in Nigeria's poultry, of which the 1st one affected a backyard holding, while the last 3 involved commercial or semi-commercial poultry farms. The single, thus far, follow-up report (No. 1), addressing 3 outbreaks, was submitted to the OIE on 15 Feb 2021; it includes a map and is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=38247.

The case involved a 50-year-old man living in Hechi in Guangxi. He developed symptoms on [16 Feb 2021] and was admitted for treatment on [17 Feb 2021] due to severe pneumonia. The patient passed away on [2 Mar 2021].From 2014 to date, 30 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by China mainland health authorities.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. The clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches), or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza viruses through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[China's 1st avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N6 strain was isolated in March 2014 from a domestic duck in Guangdong Province. Since then, the H5 subtype has gradually become the main cause of the sporadic AIV infections in poultry in southern China. To date, a total of 25 laboratory-confirmed cases (excluding the case above) of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 7 deaths at the time of the IHR (International Health Regulations) report, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014 (https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/).According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. With the continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map of China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8265645,11869]"

These are the 1st reported detections of avian influenza A(H5N8) in humans.Positive clinical specimens were collected from poultry farm workers who participated in a response operation to contain an avian influenza A(H5N8) outbreak detected in a poultry farm in Astrakhan Oblast in the Russian Federation. The laboratory confirmation of the 7 specimens was performed by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR (WHO H5 Reference Laboratory). The ages of the 7 positive cases ranged between 29 to 60 years, and 5 were female.Between 3 and 11 Dec 2020, a total of 101 000 out of 900 000 egg-laying hens on the farm died. This high mortality rate prompted an investigation. Samples were collected from these birds, and an initial detection of avian influenza A(H5N8) was performed by the Russian regional veterinary laboratory. On 11 Dec 2020, the outbreak was confirmed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference laboratory, and the Federal Centre for Animal Health (FGBI-ARRIAH), in Vladimir, the Russian Federation. Outbreak containment operations started immediately and continued for several days due to the large size of the poultry farm.The cases remained asymptomatic for the whole follow up duration (several weeks). Follow up nasopharyngeal swabs were collected during the medical observation period and were tested negative for avian influenza A(H5N8). No obvious clinical manifestations were reported from any farm workers under medical surveillance, their family members, or other close contacts of the 7 cases. Additionally, acute and convalescent sera were collected from the 7 positive human cases for serological testing. The results were suggestive of recent infection.Influenza A(H5N8) viruses isolated from this poultry outbreak in Astrakhan belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b of avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses. In 2020, avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses were also detected in poultry or wild birds in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation.On receiving the initial signal of a probable outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) at the poultry farm on 3 Dec 2020, the national authorities took immediate measures including cessation of poultry production cycles and product transportation from the affected farm.Between 11 and 18 Dec 2020, several measures, including culling and disposing of poultry, eggs, and litter, and disinfection of contaminated premises, were taken as part of outbreak response activities.During and after the culling of all the poultry, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum samples were collected from poultry farm workers and personnel involved in outbreak response at the farm. Surveillance activities, both within and outside of the containment area, were intensified. A total of 24 close contacts of the confirmed cases have been identified and traced. In total, 150 individuals were monitored for clinical indication of respiratory disease, and they received antiviral prophylaxis therapy. No symptoms were reported among these individuals.Whole Genome Sequencing of avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses isolated from poultry and from one of the 7 human cases was performed and uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database on 20 Feb 2021. Genetic and phenotypic characterization of the virus is ongoing.WHO is following up with public health authorities in the Russian Federation, including implementation of public health measures warranted by such events, and with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) on further analysis and assessment of the virus materials and serum samples. On 20 Feb 2021, a special briefing by the head of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing was organized for the state Russian media to inform the public about these cases and the implications.Since 2004, avian influenza A(H5) viruses have spread from Asia to Europe via wild birds. The genetic clade 2.3.4.4 H5 viruses have often reassorted among other avian influenza viruses, resulting in avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N5), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses, some of which have been detected in birds in many countries.In the Russian Federation, avian influenza A(H5N8) of clade 2.3.4.4 was isolated for the 1st time in 2014 in a wild bird in the northern region of the Russian Far East.As mentioned earlier, all the 7 cases with PCR-positive results were clinically asymptomatic. All close contacts of these cases were clinically monitored, and no one showed signs of clinical illness. Infections with avian influenza viruses of the same clade (H5 clade 2.3.4.4) have been reported from China since 2014 in people with exposure to infected birds. The likelihood of human infections with influenza A(H5N8) viruses has been considered to be low.Further genetic and antigenic characterization and information on seroconversion among contacts of the positive cases is required to fully assess the risk.The development of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses for potential use in human vaccines, coordinated by WHO, remains an essential component of the overall global strategy for influenza pandemic preparedness.Based on currently available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low.These cases do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of animal and seasonal human influenza, which should continue to be implemented. Respiratory transmission occurs mainly by droplets, disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes. Short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses may occur, particularly in crowded enclosed spaces. Hand contamination, direct inoculation of virus, exposure to infected birds or virus-contaminated materials or environments are potential sources of infection.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific, high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, and litter, and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on how to protect themselves, and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Thorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted.

Evidence of illness is not required.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection, a thorough epidemiological investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted, even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.Based on the currently available information, WHO advises against any special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions on travel and/or trade with the Russian Federation.For further information and details, please see:- Current technical information including monthly risk assessments at the Human-Animal Interface WHO- WHO Influenza virus infections in humans October 2018- Case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR (2005)- International Health Regulations IHR (2005)- Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza (2011)- Terms of Reference for National Influenza Centers of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.--Communicated by:ProMED Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[The above report provides additional details about the 7 human cases of avian influenza A/H5N8 reported almost one week ago.

Other strains -- H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 -- have been known here to spread to humans.Russia reported the case of human infection to the WHO ""several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results,"" Popova said on Rossiya 24 state TV. There was no sign yet of transmission between humans, she added.Seven workers at a poultry plant in Russia's south had been infected with the H5N8 strain in an outbreak at the plant in December [2020], Popova said, adding that the individuals involved felt fine now. ""This situation did not develop further,"" she said.In an email, WHO's European arm said it had been notified by Russia about a case of human infection with H5N8 and acknowledged that this would, if confirmed, be the 1st time the strain had infected people.""Preliminary information indicates that the reported cases were workers exposed to bird flocks,"" the email said. ""They were asymptomatic, and no onward human-to-human transmission was reported. We are in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and assess the public health impact of this event,"" the email added.The majority of human bird flu infections have been associated with direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered to be safe.Bird flu outbreaks often prompt poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus from spreading and to avoid importing countries having to impose trade restrictions.The vast majority of cases are spread by migrating wild birds, so producing countries tend to keep their poultry indoors or protected from contact with wildlife.Siberia's Vector Institute said on Sat 20 Feb 2021 that it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, RIA news agency reported.[Byline: Polina Devitt, Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: 22 Feb 2021Source: BBC [abridged, edited]https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56140270Russia has reported the 1st case of a bird flu strain, H5N8, being passed from poultry to humans.Officials said 7 workers at a poultry plant in the south of the country had been infected following an outbreak there in December 2020.""All 7 people are now feeling well,"" said the head of Russia's consumer health watchdog, Anna Popova. She said that adequate measures had been quickly taken to stop the spread of infection.There was no sign of transmission between humans, Ms Popova said, adding that the case had been reported to the World Health Organization.She praised ""the important scientific discovery"" by Russia's Vektor laboratory, which had isolated the strain's genetic material from the infected workers.""The discovery of these mutations when the virus has not still acquired an ability to transmit from human to human gives us all, the entire world, time to prepare for possible mutations and react in an adequate and timely fashion,"" Ms Popova said.She said Russian scientists could now start working on developing test systems.Other strains of bird flu occasionally infect humans and have led to deaths, but this is the 1st report of the H5N8 strain being passed on.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[Avian influenza or ""bird flu"" is a disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. It can affect all species of birds, some other animals (e.g., cats, horses) and can very rarely infect humans. Only virus types H5 and H7 are known to cause the highly pathogenic (HPAI) form of the disease. The most well-known examples are the avian influenza subtype H5N1 viruses currently circulating in poultry in parts of Asia and northeast Africa, which have caused human disease and deaths since 1997. Other avian influenza subtypes, including H7N9 and H9N2, have also infected people. Some of these infections have been very severe, and some have resulted in deaths, but many infections have been mild or even without symptoms in humans.H5N8 is a subtype of the influenza A virus, which is highly lethal in wild birds and poultry. Poultry outbreaks due to influenza A/H5N8 have been reported as early as 1983 in Ireland, and since 2010, H5N8-associated outbreaks were detected among wild birds in Asia with subsequent spread to domestic birds across China, South Korea, and Japan [1-3]. In 2016, a novel reassortant virus of subtype H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 was reported in Russia, with further spread to many countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East [4-5].The spread of HPAI (H5N8) strains has been linked to the overlapping flyways of migratory wild birds that come from different continents; this mingling of wild birds poses a major concern worldwide [6-7].All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). This includes any influenza A virus that has demonstrated the capacity to infect humans when its haemagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those -- i.e. A(H1) or A(H3) -- circulating widely in the human population. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface [8].The above newswires report the 1st human cases of avian influenza A/H5N8 and highlight the potential for zoonotic transmission of this novel subtype and other influenza viruses and the need for continuous monitoring and surveillance of the circulating strains in animals and humans. In this regard, Global influenza surveillance has been conducted through WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) since 1952, with key objectives:- Global mechanism of surveillance, preparedness and response for seasonal, pandemic and zoonotic influenza;- Global platform for monitoring influenza epidemiology and disease; and- Global alert for novel influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens.There are enough historical events that have resulted in limited or global pandemics due to influenza, and more recently, novel SARS-CoV2, that highlight the need for a One Health approach towards public health preparedness.H5N8 is typically not associated with humans; however, as per the recent reports from various sources, up to 7 people in Russia have been found to be infected with the virus to date.References:1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N82.

Compared to H5 and H7 viruses, of which many are of high pathogenicity in poultry (HPAIV), they are somewhat neglected. This is partially the outcome of LPAIV strains, such as H9N2, being -- in difference with HPAIV viruses -- pathogens which are not OIE notifiable, causing relatively few overt human infections though significant economic losses.In many resource-limited regions surveillance is performed sporadically, or not at all. It is likely that H9N2 viruses are present, or endemic, in more countries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia; Senegal seems to be a recent example. A map presenting the distribution of the virus in Eurasia and Africa, as of June 2019, is available in ref 1 below.H9N2 viruses are fairly regularly isolated from humans. The 1st reported human cases involved 2 children, in Hong Kong in 1999, who exhibited flu-like symptoms. Retrospectively, several H9N2 infections had occurred in mainland China during 1998. Subsequent human infections have been reported from Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Oman, now followed by India and Senegal.Human H9N2 infections are generally mild and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc).

The most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines.The human case in Senegal, a country in which hitherto H9N2 in poultry has not been reported, is an important development and further information on the epidemiological situation of the case, specifically about outbreaks in poultry in the region, would be highly appreciated.References----------1.

The boy was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital's isolation ward. The Centre for Health Protection on Friday [7 Feb 2020] confirmed that the boy's nasal swab tested positive for the strain of avian flu, with the subtype still to be determined. The boy had recently returned to the city from mainland China.The centre said the boy had underlying illnesses and developed a cough and runny nose on Tuesday [4 Feb 2020], which turned to a fever on Wednesday [5 Feb 2020]. He went for treatment at the outpatient ward at the Wang Tau Hom Jockey Club Clinic and was transferred to an isolation ward at Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei for further medical care. He was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital's isolation ward on Thursday [6 Feb 2020], where his condition was stable.According to the centre's preliminary investigations, the patient had visited his grandparents' home in Shenzhen at the incubation stage of his viral infection. Although the family kept poultry in their house, the boy had not come into direct contact with the birds. His family members have not reported any symptoms.A Department of Health spokesperson said investigations were underway and the relevant medical staff at the clinic, ambulance and hospitals, as well as any possibly affected patients, had been placed under medical observation.H9 is a seasonal influenza that is required by law to be reported to the city's health authorities. Hong Kong has in total recorded 8 H9N2 infections, the most recent an imported case in 2013. The virus is a relatively mild type of avian flu, and no local deaths have been recorded.Hong Kong is also battling a strain of coronavirus that originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. The flulike virus -- contracted by 31 500 people worldwide, mostly in the province -- has infected 26 people in the city, killing one.Dr Joseph Tsang Kay-yan, a private specialist in infectious disease, said he believed the boy was an isolated case. ""If we see similar cases or many local birds dying of unknown causes, then that would warrant further concern,"" Tsang said.[byline: Victor Ting]--communicated by:Mary Marshall<mjm2020@googlemail.com>******[2]Date: Fri 7 Feb 2020Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]http://outbreaknewstoday.com/hong-kong-imported-h9-influenza-case-coronavirus-update-92598/Hong Kong health officials reported an imported case of influenza A (H9) infection today [7 Feb 2020].The patient, a 7 year old boy with underlying illnesses, developed a cough and runny nose on 4 Feb 2020 and fever on the next day. On 5 Feb 2020, he was brought to Wang Tau Hom Jockey Club General Outpatient Clinic (GOPC) for medical advice and was transferred to Kwong Wah Hospital (KWH), where he was admitted to the isolation ward for further management. He was transferred to the general ward of KWH yesterday [6 Feb 2020] and then was transferred to the isolation ward of Princess Margaret Hospital for treatment today [7 Feb 2020]. He has been in stable condition.His nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for the influenza A (H9) virus upon testing. Subtyping result is pending. His clinical diagnosis was avian influenza.Preliminary investigation by the CHP [Centre for Health Protection] revealed that the patient visited his maternal grandparents' home in Shenzhen during the incubation period, where backyard poultry was kept. However, the patient had no direct poultry contact recently, nor consumption of undercooked poultry or contact with patients. His home contacts have remained asymptomatic so far.Novel influenza A infection, including influenza A(H9), is a notifiable infectious disease in Hong Kong. Eight cases of influenza A (H9N2) have been reported in the past, including 2 local cases in 1999, one local case each in 2003 and 2007, an imported case in 2008, an imported case and one with the source of infection unclassified in 2009, and one imported case in 2013. No deaths have been recorded so far. Influenza A (H9N2) infection is a mild form of avian influenza.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As mentioned in the above report, A/H9 influenza is essentially an avian virus and not seasonal or human.There are 9 known subtypes of H9 viruses (H9N1, H9N2, H9N3, H9N4, H9N5, H9N6, H9N7, H9N8, and H9N9); all H9 viruses identified worldwide in wild birds and poultry are LPAI viruses. H9N2 virus has been detected in bird populations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Rare, sporadic H9N2 virus infections in people have been reported to generally cause mild upper respiratory tract illness; one infection has resulted in death (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/influenza-a-virus-subtypes.htm).It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories.WHO guidelines, entitled ""Protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases"", are available at https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275657/WHO-WHE-IHM-GIP-2018.2-eng.pdf.Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, member states are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Hong Kong: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6967624,198.]"
