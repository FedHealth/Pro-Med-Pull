""The DNR and MDARD are working that plan with other experts and stakeholders and taking advantage of every available resource that aims to limit the spread of HPAI.""Eichinger also said the state's ongoing focus is to prevent the disease's spread.According to the state's wildlife HPAI plan, the DNR has already canceled the roundup and relocation of Canada geese for the year, and will only make limited exceptions in approved situations. The DNR is also refunding application fees for sites that have received roundup permits.Due to the cancellation, the DNR is also encouraging nest and egg destruction to resolve conflicts. There is no eligibility requirements for nest and egg destruction in 2022, nor is there any charge for permits for this activity.MDARD, the DNR, Michigan State University, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and the US Department of Agriculture's Veterinary Services and Wildlife Services are working together to conduct avian influenza surveillance and to monitor health of poultry, livestock, wildlife, and residents in Michigan.As of right now, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider the risk to people from HPAI viruses to be low since there are no detections of infections in people within the US.DNR is asking Michiganders who notice the death of 3 or more free-ranging birds to report it to the DNR either through the Eyes in the Field app [https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ors/Home?utm_campaign=avian%20influenza%20wild%20birds%203counties&utm_medium=pr&utm_source=govdelivery] or by calling 517-336-5030.And if your domestic poultry is experiencing severe illness or multiple death losses they are asking for you to contact MDARD at 800-292-3939.--Communicated by:ProMED[HealthMap/ProMED map of Michigan, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702266,225Michigan county map: https://geology.com/county-map/michigan-county-map.gif]******[2] Colorado (Sedgwick County): wild gooseDate: Fri 25 Mar 2022 3:23 PM MDTSource: Julesburg Advocate [edited]https://www.julesburgadvocate.com/2022/03/25/avian-influenza-confirmed-in-dead-geese-at-jumbo-reservoir/The Colorado Department of Agriculture has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, known as HPA, in wild Snow and Ross's geese in Sedgwick County.The confirmation comes after testing done by CDA, the Colorado Department of Parks and Wildlife, and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.The birds were collected by CPW [Colorado Parks and Wildlife] [17 Mar 2022] after several sick and dead geese were found at Jumbo Reservoir. The birds were necropsied at the CPW Wildlife Health Laboratory and samples were submitted to the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The samples tested positive and these results were confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory on March 24, 2022. This is the 1st confirmed case of HPAI in wild birds in Colorado.According to a release issued Friday [25 Mar 2022], there have been no detections of HPAI in commercial or backyard poultry flocks in Colorado. The USDA publishes all detections of HPAI in wild and domestic birds on its website.Dr Maggie Baldwin, Colorado State Veterinarian, said it's not surprising to find cases of HPAI in northeast Colorado.""With the number of cases of HPAI we have seen across many eastern and Midwest states, it is not unexpected to have a detection in wild birds in Colorado,"" Baldwin said. ""However, this detection emphasizes the importance for all poultry and bird owners to increase their biosecurity to protect the domestic poultry in the state. While our primary goal is prevention, we are also working to increase preparedness in the event that we do have a domestic poultry detection of HPAI in the state to respond quickly and eliminate the virus. Rapid detection and response is the best way to protect and safeguard animals and the food supply.""HPAI is a reportable disease. It is important for veterinarians and producers to report any suspicious disease events in poultry flocks to the State Veterinarian's office at 303-869-9130. If it is after hours, the voicemail message will indicate which veterinarian is on call.HPAI is a highly contagious and fatal foreign animal disease in domestic poultry. Wild birds can spread this virus to domestic poultry and certain strains of avian influenza can be transmitted to humans. This does not present a food safety risk; properly prepared and cooked poultry products and eggs are safe for human consumption.Poultry producers and bird owners should increase biosecurity measures to help prevent HPAI from occurring in Colorado's domestic poultry flocks. The most important biosecurity practices include limiting exposure of domestic birds to wild birds and other poultry flocks and limiting introduction of new birds into flocks. People, equipment, vehicles, and other objects can also serve as a mechanism for transmission of disease and are important considerations when implementing biosecurity measures.[Byline: Jeff Rice]--Communicated by:ProMED[HealthMap/ProMED map of Colorado, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702266,68699Colorado county map: https://geology.com/county-map/colorado-county-map.gif]******[3] South Dakota: wild gooseDate: Fri 25 Mar 2022 10:57 AMSource: Mitchell Republic [edited]https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/sports/northland-outdoors/avian-flu-confirmed-in-canada-goose-near-mitchell-cemeteryCity officials say a case of avian flu has been detected in a goose near the Mitchell cemetery.According to Parks and Recreation Director Kevin Nelson, the investigation began after a city official noticed a goose acting strange Thursday [24 Mar 2022].Nelson said a wildlife biologist confirmed the suspected goose that was roaming around the cemetery near Lake Mitchell tested positive for avian flu, more commonly known as bird flu.""They contacted a wildlife biologist, and they were able to do some testing with a mask and gloves. It turned out that it had avian flu,"" Nelson in an interview with the Mitchell Republic. ""There were droppings in the area by the cemetery that they were able to identify.""According to the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks, the state's 1st case of avian influenza was confirmed in 2015 at a commercial turkey farm in Beadle County, which is about 50 miles [about 80 km] north of the Mitchell area.The latest cases of bird flu were detected in several snow geese and Canada geese in early March [2022] at 2 commercial turkey plants in Charles Mix County, GF&P [Game, Fish and Parks] officials say.""As in past outbreaks, significant impacts to commercial poultry operations and backyard poultry flocks have been seen. We have also seen confirmed and suspected mortality several migratory waterfowl and raptor species in SD over the past several weeks,"" said Rocco Murano, a senior waterfowl biologist with GF&P. ""Common symptoms are lethargy, tremors, inability to walk/fly and a twisted neck.""Luckily, Murano said, the migration of arctic geese is progressing extremely rapidly this year [2022]. While the state could expect low levels interspecies transmission, Murano hopes the mortality rate will remain low.""It is generally thought that the avian influenza virus doesn't tolerate warm conditions as well which should slow spread as spring weather warms into summer,"" Murano said. ""It remains to be seen if this outbreak fizzles out over the summer or re-emerges in the fall. It is likely that a cooperative monitoring effort involving state and federal agencies will begin prior to fall migration.""State GF&P has been working with the South Dakota Animal Industry Board (AIB) and the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to monitor and respond to additional outbreaks of avian influenza.According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, avian influenza is transmissible from birds to humans. The virus can be transmitted to humans through a person's eyes, nose, and mouth. Mild symptoms of the bird flu can range from upper respiratory sickness such as coughing, sore throat, fatigue, and headaches. More severe symptoms in humans include pneumonia, vomiting, fevers, and seizures.While bird flu is transmissible to humans, the CDC says the spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to another ""is very rare."" According to the CDC, bird flu in humans can only be detected through lab testing, meaning doctors are not able to clinically diagnose a human with the virus.[Byline: Meredith Radford]--Communicated by:ProMED[HealthMap/ProMED map of South Dakota, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702266,243South Dakota county map: https://geology.com/county-map/south-dakota-county-map.gif]******[4] Pennsylvania: bald eagleDate: Sat 26 Mar 2022 9:18 AM EDTSource: CBS Pittsburgh [edited]https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2022/03/26/avian-flu-pennsylvania/The Pennsylvania Game Commission announced on Friday [25 Mar 2022] that a bald eagle found dead near Philadelphia tested positive for the highly contagious virus, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1).This is the 1st known case of HPAI H5N1 in the state since the disease was first discovered in the United States in late 2021, according to the commission.Another 5 deceased birds from Kahle Lake on the border of Clarion and Venango Counties are being tested for the flu as well.The virus can be deadly for multiple species of birds, including but not limited to turkey, hawks, eagles, gulls, ducks, and geese.Birds can be experiencing the virus while seeming totally healthy, but some symptoms include losing control of flight or other obvious signs of neurological dysfunction.""While this HPAI outbreak does not appear to have significantly impacted wild bird populations, it has the potential to significantly affect the commercial poultry industry and international trade,"" the Pennsylvania Game Commission said.Earlier this month [March 2022], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low but that they are continuing to monitor the situation.--Communicated by:ProMED[HealthMap/ProMED map of Pennsylvania, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702266,240Pennsylvania county map: https://geology.com/county-map/pennsylvania-county-map.gifThe HPAI H5N1 Eurasian variant first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. During the 1st weeks, the propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to have been associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway, but it has been showing up in western states.It is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB] See Also

The state said the facility has nearly 54 000 turkeys being destroyed to prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease. The virus can wipe out a flock within 48 hours.Buena Vista County has been under a state disaster proclamation since 6 Mar 2022 when the first outbreak was reported in a commercial flock of nearly 50 000 turkeys. And a week ago, the state said the deadly disease hit an egg-laying operation with 5.3 million hens.The disaster proclamation enables the state agriculture department and other agencies to help track, monitor and contain the disease. Officials are testing 7 flocks in a 6-mile area around the infected site, and monitoring 14 others, said Chloe Carson, the department's spokeswoman.Midwestern states are struggling to contain a virulent strain of bird flu having doomed millions of turkeys and chickens since March [2022]. Iowa has struggled with avian influenza outbreaks in backyard flocks in Pottawattamie and Warren counties, and at a Taylor County operation with about 916 000 pullets, or young laying hens.On Wednesday [23 Mar 2022], the agriculture department canceled all live bird competitions and exhibits at county fairs and the Iowa State Fair. The agency said it was prohibiting live bird sales at auctions, markets, swap meets and exotic sales. State officials believe wild birds are infecting domestic poultry with highly pathogenic avian influenza. Iowa is part of the Mississippi flyway, a migration route for millions of birds each year.State and federal agencies said none of the birds nor any poultry products from flocks where avian influenza is detected will reach US food supplies. No human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in the United States. ""This is a difficult time for poultry producers as HPAI (highly pathogen avian influenza) continues to impact farms across Iowa and the United States,"" said Iowa agriculture secretary Mike Naig. Nationally, 17 states have reported outbreaks of bird flu among commercial or backyard flocks, with about 14 million birds destroyed to prevent the virus' spread, the US Department of Agriculture reported on Thursday [24 Mar 2022].Iowa leads the nation in egg production, with 55 million laying hens producing 16 billion eggs annually, and it ranks 7th nationally for turkey production, raising 12 million birds a year. A 2015 outbreak led to the destruction of 32.7 million laying hens, turkeys and other birds in Iowa. That was about two-thirds of the 50.5 million destroyed nationally.Officials urge flock owners to prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and to immediately report sick birds or unusual deaths.[byline: Donnelle Eller]--communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts******[2] Missouri (Lawrence County): commercial turkeysDate: Thu 24 Mar 2022 07:00 CDTSource: Lawrence County Record [edited]http://www.lawrencecountyrecord.com/content/avian-influenza-infects-flock-almost-38000-turkeys-law-coA flock of 37 770 commercial turkeys that were being raised in Lawrence County were confirmed to be infected with avian influenza (AI). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) stated on their website the birds were confirmed to be infected on Wed 9 Mar 2022. The flock has since been ""depopulated,"" a commonly used term for killed.According to information from the Missouri Department of Agriculture (MDA), AI viruses are influenza type A viruses that naturally occur in bird populations and transmitted from bird to bird ""through fecal droppings, saliva, and nasal discharges."" Infections in humans are rare.Besides the case in Lawrence County, 4 other cases of AI have been confirmed in Missouri, according to the USDA website. The first confirmed case was in Stoddard County, where the USDA confirmed on 4 Mar 2022 a flock of 360 000 commercial broiler chickens were infected. That same day, they also confirmed a flock of 51 ""backyard mixed species"" of non-poultry birds in Bates County were also infected. A flock of 25 015 commercial turkeys in Jasper County were discovered to be infected on 8 Mar 2022, and the latest confirmation was in Ralls County, where 75 non-poultry birds were found to be infected on 15 Mar 2022. All of the infected birds were depopulated.Christi Miller, communications director for the MDA, said it was unknown how the birds in the confirmed cases were infected. According to information from the MDA website, the virus can be transmitted to birds in the North American flyways when they intermingle with birds from Europe and Asia. ""Positive tests in wild waterfowl can occur, and waterfowl can be infected and show no signs of illness,"" website stated. ""There is a risk for spillover from wild birds into domestic poultry and then spill back from poultry to wild birds, resulting in further spread."" The MDA stated some of the warning signs a flock has been infected include a decrease in water or feed consumption, respiratory signs such as coughing and sneezing, quietness among the flock, a decrease in egg production and a sudden increase of death in the flock.Poultry growers are being asked to take precautions to prevent the spread of AI. Among these are restricting visitors from access to their flocks, preventing flocks from having contact from wild birds, and refraining from visiting other poultry growers. Other suggestions include having a set of clothing and footwear only worn when working with their birds, disinfecting footwear before entering barns or coops, and washing hands before and after handling birds.Poultry growers are also asked to reduce any availability of food, water and nesting areas for wild birds and to fix any holes in roofs, screens and walls of poultry coops to keep wild birds from entering. Likewise, it is recommended that poultry growers clean and disinfect the wheels of any vehicle that has been to another poultry farm, as well as clean and disinfect any equipment that another poultry grower has borrowed and returned.Any poultry grower who suspects their birds may be infected should immediately contact their local veterinarian or MDA Animal Health Division. Miller stated the names of all poultry growers whose flocks are found to be infected are kept confidential. The MDA also stated chicken and other poultry products are safe to eat if cooked properly, and none of the infected birds are in the food supply. They also stated US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk for infection to the general public to be low.[byline: Steve Chapman]--communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts******[3] Missouri (Ralls County): backyard flockDate: Thu 24 Mar 2022Source: Hannibal Courier Post [edited]https://www.hannibal.net/news/avian-flu-reported-in-ralls-county/article_0e64aefa-aaf0-11ec-a971-23f660df6d62.htmlThe Missouri Department of Agriculture has reported 5 cases of avian influenza in Ralls County. The cases were confirmed on 15 Mar 2022, and poultry owners in Ralls County received a visit from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) encouraging them to keep their poultry locked up.Christi Miller, communications director at Missouri Department of Agriculture, said the avian flu comes in various strains, just like the human influenza. This particular strain of the avian flu is what they call a highly pathogenic avian influenza, which means it is a highly contagious and deadly strand.The last highly pathogenic virus reported was in 2020 and spreads when poultry mingles with waterfowl migrating for the season. Miller confirmed the virus impacts poultry only and will not spread to other livestock. She reports that the 5 chickens affected by the virus are within the same flock and it has not spread to any other premises in Ralls County. [It is unclear if this 5 birds or 5 cases of chickens being affected. - Mod.TG]The virus has been found in 4 other Missouri counties, including Stoddard, Bates, Jasper and Lawrence counties. Miller said all cases have been contained to one premises and have not spread to date. ""We have been very fortunate this year [2022] in the locations where we have had it in our state, there has only been one premise having been impacted and I think it's a real testament to the biosecurity of those producers,"" she said. ""They are doing a good job of keeping their animals and flock contained and mitigating that spread.""Signs of the avian influenza include a quieting of the flock, a refusal to eat or drink, a decrease of egg production, and sudden deaths within the flock.[MJ] and [JJ] raise chickens on a farm in Ralls County. They had just released their flocks to free-range after the winter 2 days before they received a personal visit earlier this week from the USDA informing them of the outbreak. It is the first time they have dealt with avian flu, and they are taking the precautions suggested by the USDA. ""We have several different coops with different breeds of chickens. So we're just keeping everything separate,"" [MJ] said. ""We've got all our layers in one coop and the special breeds in other coops."" They were told it might be a while before they can release their flocks again.Miller said a specific time can't be pinpointed, but hopes to see a decrease by April or May [2022]. She believes the virus will slow down as the weather heats up, as it doesn't pronounce itself as much in heat. ""When the weather is warming up and those birds have moved on through that's when we usually start seeing a decrease and we certainly hope is the case this year,"" she said.Officials from the USDA or Missouri Department of Agriculture will make at least one more round of visits to check on the status of area poultry, and Miller said these officials will always have a marked vehicle and badges to identify themselves. She encourages all livestock owners to fill out a premises ID form on their website in order to ensure they receive important information and updates when things like this happen. Miller assured consumers the food supply is not affected by the avian flu and the eggs and poultry in the supermarket and local grocery stores are safe to eat. She added poultry and eggs should always be cooked to the proper temperature.If someone suspects the avian flu in their flock, they can talk to their local veterinarian who will then get in touch with the Missouri Department of Agriculture. They can also call the Missouri Department of Agriculture's animal health division.[byline: Meg Duncan]--communicated by:ProMED rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi******[4] Maine (Cumberland County): mixed flocksDate: Fri 25 Mar 2022Source: Bangor Daily News [edited]https://bangordailynews.com/2022/03/25/news/cumberland-is-5th-maine-county-to-report-avian-flu-cases/More cases of the deadly avian influenza have been reported in Cumberland County. The cases affected a mixed flock of about 150 poultry and were reported on 22 Mar 2022, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The H5N1 avian influenza, a deadly disease that was first identified in Maine in a small flock in Knox County in February [2022], has the state on high alert. Keepers of backyard poultry flocks are being urged to take every precaution to prevent its spread. Cases also have been detected in Washington, Knox, Lincoln and York counties. So far in Maine it has been found in both domestic and wild birds.Symptoms include swollen heads, blue coloration of combs and wattles, lack of appetite, respiratory distress and diarrhea with a significant drop in egg production. These symptoms are particularly severe in chickens and turkeys.If there is any question about the health of an individual bird or entire flock, it is crucial to report those cases to state officials.[byline: Leela Stockley]--communicated by:ProMED rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi[If possible, keep your flocks inside to protect them from co-mingling with wild birds.

On this occasion, it has been detected in a fattening turkey farm in the Sevillian municipality of Arahal. A total of about 17 700 birds are believed to be on the farm. It is located within the radius of the surveillance zone previously declared by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Sustainable Development in a neighbouring municipality.This latest outbreak brings the total of [outbreaks] detected in Andalusia to 28. As detailed by the Junta de Andalucia, 22 of them are in the province of Sevilla, and the remaining 6 in Huelva.An abnormal increase in the mortality of animals on the Arahal farm was detected last Tuesday [15 Mar 2022]. The official veterinary services of the Junta de Andalucia were notified, and the established protocol was followed, with samples taken and sent to the Central Laboratory of Algete for analysis. The veterinary services of the Andalucian administration immediately proceeded to isolate the affected farm. A rigorous epidemiological survey was conducted to find out the possible origin of the outbreaks.This can help to establish if other farms are at risk due to the movement of people and vehicles from the affected facility. In addition, all the birds on the farm were slaughtered, while the feed and other materials that could carry the virus were disposed of. Similarly, a restriction zone has been established around the outbreak, with a 3 km [1.9 mi] protection zone, and a 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone.As in the previous outbreaks detected in the provinces of Sevilla and Huelva, the analysis carried out has shown that it is avian influenza of the H5N1 subtype. This is the one that has been affecting Europe in recent months. Although it has not shown any zoonotic potential, exposure to birds showing any symptoms consistent with the disease or found dead in the field is not recommended.[byline: Chris King]--communicated by:ProMED[The current HPAI H5N1 epizootic, which started in Europe in September 2021, seemed to have peaked during the 2nd week of 2022, decreasing until the 8th week; the number of outbreaks has again been increasing across Europe since the 9th week of 2022.

Previously, cases had been found on the northern edge of the nation's largest broiler chicken area.This avian influenza detection follows previously announced cases on farms in New Castle County and Cecil and Queen Anne's Counties, Maryland. Since the cases were found, federal and state partners have expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen.State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and the birds have been killed to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus spreading quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. The virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, turkeys, and wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.--communicated by:ProMED[ProMED map of Delaware, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702172,16965Delaware county map: https://geology.com/county-map/delaware-county-map.gif]******[2] Maine (Lincoln, York, Knox counties): backyard flocksDate: Fri 18 Mar 2022Source: WGME Portland [edited]https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/cases-of-avian-flu-found-in-two-more-maine-counties/ar-AAVdgtqNew cases of the highly contagious bird flu have been discovered in Maine. This time, the cases have been found in birds in 2 more counties. So far, nearly 7 million chickens and turkeys in the US have been killed this year [2022] because of the virus.In Maine, officials confirmed reports of it last month [February 2022] in Knox County. Now it's been found in flocks in Lincoln and York Counties. In York County, there are 2 new confirmed cases in a backyard flock of 173 birds. There are also 2 confirmed cases in Lincoln County in a backyard flock of 70 birds. In Knox County, cases have been confirmed in backyard pet chickens in a flock of 96. Also in Knox County, cases have been confirmed in a flock of 27.The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry has placed the properties under quarantine and have implemented safety measures. Those safety measures include monitoring properties with domestic flocks and notifying bird owners of the importance of safety measures to help prevent disease.They say the risk remains high, and backyard flocks and commercial operators should keep their birds indoors to prevent the spread of the disease. Jim Britt with the Department of Agriculture says, unfortunately, death is a primary indicator of the avian flu. ""The best thing a bird owner of or a backyard flock owner or a commercial flock owner is to keep those birds inside to keep them away from wild birds,"" Britt said. ""Migratory wild birds are the culprit of bringing the flu to Maine."" Britt says the avian flu is a very low risk to humans and as long as poultry and eggs are cooked properly, there should be no concerns if your food is safe.--communicated by:ProMED[ProMED map of Maine, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702172,222Maine county map: https://geology.com/county-map/maine-county-map.gif]******[3] Iowa (Buena Vista County): commercial poultryDate: Sat 19 Mar 2022 9:27 AM CDTSource: The Gazette, Iowa Capital Dispatch report [edited]https://www.thegazette.com/agriculture/bird-flu-hits-flock-of-5-3-million-iowa-hens/A highly contagious and deadly avian influenza has been detected in an immense flock of egg-laying chickens in Northwest Iowa, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship reported on Friday [18 Mar 2022]. The Buena Vista County flock has 5.3 million birds, said Chloe Carson, a spokesperson for the department. The virus was confirmed on Thursday [17 Mar 2022]. It is the 2nd flock in the county to be infected and the 4th in Iowa this year [2022].The county was among the hardest hit in Iowa by a bird flu outbreak in 2015 and is under a governor's disaster proclamation to assist with the detection and containment of the disease. State agricultural officials have said they have a goal to cull infected flocks within 24 hours of detection to prevent the virus' spread.Migrating wild birds -- which often don't suffer the same deadly symptoms as domestic birds -- are the likely sources of the outbreaks, State Veterinarian Jeff Kaisand has said. The state agriculture department doesn't identify the specific locations of the outbreaks.The virus was previously identified in a Taylor County flock of about 919 000 egg-laying chickens on [10 Mar 2022], a Buena Vista flock of 50 000 turkeys on [6 Mar 2022], and a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks in Pottawattamie County on [1 Mar 2022].It has been identified in a total of 39 commercial and backyard flocks in 17 states, with new confirmations coming on a nearly daily basis, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The latest affected flock in Iowa is the largest among them.The series of outbreaks in 2015 led to the culling of more than 30 million birds in Iowa.

The state Department of Agriculture said the highly contagious disease has been found in a flock of 570 000 broiler chickens in Butler County.The Agriculture Department said the farm has been quarantined and all 570 000 birds will be destroyed. It also has set up a 6.2-mile [10 km] control zone around the farm, and poultry producers within that radius will not be allowed to move poultry products on or off their premises without permission of the department. State veterinarian Roger Dudley said the farm had increased its safety practices and heightened observational testing. It quarantined itself after noticing higher-than-normal mortality among its flock and notified the department.""Having a second farm in Nebraska confirmed to have HPAI is unfortunate but not completely unexpected,"" said agriculture director Steve Wellman.

Samples from birds exhibiting HPAI signs in a non-commercial backyard mixed-species flock (poultry) in Dickinson County and also in a non-commercial backyard mixed-species flock (non-poultry) in rural Sedgwick County were confirmed today by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.KDA is working closely with USDA-APHIS on a joint incident response in both of the new locations. KDA officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on both properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease.Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard chicken owner to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. Find guidance on biosecurity on the KDA Division of Animal Health webpage at https://www.agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza. Going forward, any additional confirmed cases will be shared directly with local communities and announced on the KDA Avian Influenza webpage, rather than through a statewide news release.Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a highly contagious viral disease which can infect chickens, turkeys, and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death in infected birds. Attentively monitor your birds for signs of HPAI which include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; incoordination; and diarrhea. Avian influenza can also cause sudden death in birds even if they aren't showing other signs.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. Birds and eggs from the infected flock will not enter the food system. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and in migratory wild bird populations.For more information about HPAI, including current status of the confirmed cases in other states as well as more information about biosecurity for your flock, go to KDA's avian influenza webpage at https://www.agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza.--communicated by:ProMED[ProMED map of Kansas, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702172,219Kansas county map: https://geology.com/county-map/kansas-county-map.gifIn early 2022, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 made its way on migratory pathways into the United States. This virus continues to fly westward, spreading death and destruction to commercial and non-commercial birds. Many wild birds and almost all commercial birds in North America have little defense against this virus.To help your flocks, raise your level of biosecurity. Keep your birds inside, in a closed building with good ventilation. Be sure you are not tracking this virus into your birds. Change clothes, boots, gloves, and cover your hair and hands before entering the area where your birds are. Be sure to blow your nose before entering the birdhouses as well. Don't track this virus around. While flu flies, we each have to be careful to protect our birds at home or on the job. - Mod.TG] See Also

The operation to remove the dead birds, many of them in their nests, took place under stringent biosecurity measures to minimize further contamination.Speaking to state-run news agency Amna, deputy mayor of Amynteos Eleni Gyriki, said that 80 dead birds had been collected by fishermen going out on their boats, and placed in special bags to minimize transmission of the virus in order to be incinerated.An operation by a private company on Little Prespa Lake has collected so far 748 dead pelicans in the 4 days of operation. This is where the problem is most acute, as the reed beds in the lake house one of Europe's largest colonies of pelicans. The aim is to contain the [situation] before the second wave of migrating birds arrives at the lake in April [2022].The first dead birds were located in mid-February [2022] and the phenomenon ""exploded"" quickly. In the first 2.5 weeks 574 dead pelicans and another 24 in Lake Heimaditida were recorded, the director of the Prespa Protection Company, Myrsini Malakou, told Amna [news agency] beginning of March [2022]. She said that a total of 70 dead pelicans were found last year [2021].Authorities in Greece have been on alert this year [2022] due to the death of more than 6000 cranes in Israel, at the end of the year [2021], from bird flu. ""In the measures we make every year in the colonies, using drones and telescopes, we saw the dead birds, in a number that has never been seen before,"" Malakou said.Samples of dead animals, in collaboration with the Prespa National Park Management Agency and the municipality of Prespa, were sent to the Veterinary Service of the regional unit of Florina where it was confirmed that it is the H5N1 virus.--communicated by:ProMED******[2] UK (Scotland): wild birdsDate: Mon 21 Mar 2022Source: Ardossan & Saltcoats Herald [edited]https://www.ardrossanherald.com/news/20007910.bird-flu-avian-influenza-confirmed-north-ayrshire-disease-spreads/Cases of bird flu have been confirmed at a rescue centre in North Ayrshire as the disease continues to spread across the country. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been detected at Hessilhead Wildlife Rescue Centre, near Beith, with a 3km [about 1.8mi] protection zone and a 10km [about 6mi] surveillance zone now in place.The security measures, which took effect from 7.30pm on [Fri 18 Mar 2022] mean movement restrictions within these zones -- for example, poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure -- to prevent any further spread of disease.Advice shared by the Scottish Government said: ""Vigilance by bird keepers is important and any suspicion of disease should be reported immediately to the local Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) office."" The Scottish Government's chief vet, Sheila Voas, urged bird owners to take extra steps to protect their animals.Several cases have also been confirmed in Aberdeenshire, as well as in Angus and Dumfriesshire. A Great Britain-wide prevention zone has been in place since November [2021] and includes the requirement to house birds within the protection zones to prevent the spread of the disease.Highly pathogenic avian influenza is said to present suddenly, often with very high mortality, with affected birds developing swollen heads, blue colouration of the comb and wattles, dullness, lack of appetite, respiratory distress, diarrhoea and a significant drop in egg production. However, there can be considerable variation in the clinical picture and severity of the disease.If you are suspicious your flock has any form of avian influenza you must contact your local animal health office immediately.[byline: Ross Hanvidge]--communicated by:ProMED[Since October 2020, Europe has experienced the most severe avian influenza epidemic to date.

According to officials, the Eurasian strain called H5N1 is highly contagious and deadly. It is found in domestic poultry.If you raise chickens or domestic poultry, officials said to be aware of this novel disease, practice biosecurity, and track any unusual cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these viruses have been found in the US.--communicated by:ProMED[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January [2022] in the Atlantic coast of North America now has reached the Pacific coast. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway, although the findings of infected wild birds first in Nebraska, Missouri, and now Oregon show that the virus is quickly moving westwards.It is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMBProMED map:Pacific Northwest, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702154,68029] See Also

She developed symptoms on 20 Feb [2022] and was admitted for treatment on 23 Feb [2022]. She is in a critical condition.From 2014 to date [15 Mar 2022], 74 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by mainland health authorities. ""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.Travellers to the mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets, or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention, and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food, and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- avoid touching poultry, birds, animals, or their droppings;- when buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose, or eyes; before handling food or eating; and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels, or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and- wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page, and the YouTube Channel.--communicated by:ProMED rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi[The above report mentions one new case of avian influenza A/H5N6 in critical condition in mainland China, increasing the total cases in 2022 to 10 (the last 2 cases are now included in the 2021 tally). Accordingly, from 2014 to date, 74 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by health authorities in mainland China.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBAProMED map of China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702026,155.] See Also

The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) confirmed a case in Clay County using the National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames, Iowa. The University of Missouri Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab confirmed positive birds in Pettis, Randolph and St. Charles counties.Highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly referred to as bird flu, was first confirmed 3 Mar 2022 in a poultry flock in Stoddard County and a backyard flock in Bates County 4 Mar 2022, according to MDC.""Avian influenza viruses naturally occur in bird populations, especially waterfowl, shorebirds, and domestic birds such as chickens and turkeys,"" said Sherri Russell, MDC State Wildlife Veterinarian, via a news release. ""We have been monitoring this strain since early January [2022], when it was detected in the eastern United States and Canada.""The virus spreads as birds along the North American flyways intermingle with infected birds from other parts of the world, according to MDC. Viruses are transmitted through fecal droppings, saliva and nasal droppings among birds.""There is a risk for spillover from wild birds into domestic poultry and then back again from poultry to wild birds, resulting in further spread,"" MDC stated. MDC is working with the Missouri Department of Agriculture and other state and federal agencies to monitor the spread of the virus.""Fortunately, avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern, although on rare occasions it has infected humans and other animals,"" Russell stated. ""We recommend you avoid handling sick or dead birds, and to report sick or dead wild birds, especially waterfowl to MDC.""Look for signs of tremors, head tilting, lethargy, loss of coordination, inability to fly or walk properly, or standing upright. Wildlife Health staff are interested in reports of single waterfowl, raptor or avian scavengers. They are also interested in waterfowl or other waterbird deaths involving more than 5 birds where the cause of death is unknown.Folks can report sick or dead birds by emailing <WildlifeHealth@mdc.mo.gov> or calling their local MDC office.When it comes to hunting, MDC urges people to take ""common sense precautions"" when handling harvested birds in the field or at home. ""They should be aware that it is possible to transport avian influenza viruses on boats, waders, or other equipment, especially if it isn't dry before moving it from one site to another,"" MDC stated. ""Allowing hunting equipment to dry between outings will reduce this chance."" Russell said poultry and wild game birds are safe to eat after being cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.Situation updates of ongoing avian influenza in wild birds can be found by visiting https://mdc.mo.gov/wildlife/wildlife-diseases/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai.[Byline: Sara Karnes]--Communicated by:ProMED******[2] North Carolina: wild duck and gooseDate: Thu 17 Mar 2022 15:07 EDTSource: Public Radio for Eastern North Carolina [edited]https://www.publicradioeast.org/pre-news/2022-03-17/nc-wild-birds-are-first-confirmed-deaths-due-to-avian-fluThe 1st documented wild bird mortalities due to a highly infectious avian flu were confirmed by North Carolina natural resource agencies Wednesday [16 Mar 2022].Highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has killed at least 4 wild birds in North Carolina. According to the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, a redhead duck in Carteret County was among these birds and was observed with neurological signs consistent with bird flu before it was euthanized. The other birds were found in Dare, Hyde, and Wake counties.In January [2022], the commission confirmed a positive test in a wild duck for bird flu in Hyde County, along with a 2nd positive test in South Carolina. According to a news release, these were the 1st wild birds in the United States to have that strain of bird flu since 2016.This type of virus is considered low risk to people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but can be dangerous to other birds including domestic poultry. The public is encouraged to report unusual wild bird behavior.For more information, visit the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services website (http://www.ncagr.gov/avianflu/).[Byline: Meredith Radford]--Communicated by:ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi******[3] Florida: wild duckDate: Fri 18 Mar 2022 12:37 EDTSource: WPBF News [edited]https://www.wpbf.com/article/avian-flu-case-confirmed-martin-county/39467292#Wildlife experts in Florida have confirmed that avian influenza is present in Martin County. Savannah Steckler, a wildlife rehabilitator at the Treasure Coast Wildlife Center in Palm City, said a dead duck that was dropped off at the facility earlier this month [March 2022] had the virus. ""We actually did have, I think, 2 or 3 positive cases coming back from ducks around the Martin County area,"" Steckler said.Experts said this is an extremely infectious avian flu strain and can be deadly. ""We do get it a little bit every year,"" Steckler said. ""But not as bad as we're seeing it right now."" Steckler said they have set up a quarantine area at the wildlife center where all new arrivals will be placed and tested before being moved to the general population.According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife, there is a low risk the avian flu can spread to humans. To prevent the spread of avian flu, the public should avoid handling sick or dead wildlife.[Byline: Angela Rozier]--Communicated by:ProMED[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 in the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway, although the findings of infected wild birds first in Nebraska and then in Missouri show that the virus is already moving westwards.It is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMBProMED map:United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8702088,106] See Also

These include restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure, and restrictions on bird gatherings.Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: ""We have already made clear that all bird keepers -- whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds -- must ensure that their biosecurity is up to scratch to protect their birds from disease and prevent any contact between their birds and wild birds.""Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately. Your private vet, or your local Animal and Plant Health Agency office, will also be able to provide practical advice on keeping your birds safe from infection.""The risk to the general public's health from avian influenza is very low. However, the risk to people with intensive exposure to infected birds is considered to be low.""Food Standards Scotland advises that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products, including eggs.""Producers and bird keepers must comply with the Order to House Birds, which came into effect on 29 Nov 2021 or to ensure their birds are kept separate from wild birds. The Order is in addition to regulations that were brought in across Britain as part of the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) on 3 Nov 2021.Members of the public should not touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that they find.

All birds in this commercial flock will be destroyed. The confirmation came from a poultry flock in Charles Mix County in southeastern South Dakota along the Missouri River. The river is, of course, a major flyway for spring bird migration. South Dakota now joins Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, the Carolinas, and Maryland as states confirming HPAI infection.""I think it's not a matter of if it comes to Minnesota; it's when.""So says Minnesota Board of Animal Health senior veterinarian Shauna Voss. It's only been 7 years since around 9 million birds across 110 Minnesota farms were killed by avian influenza or were euthanized to prevent the spread. The economic impact on producers was nothing short of catastrophic. Now in 2022, avian influenza has been detected in the United States. Earlier this year [2022] it was first discovered in birds in the Carolinas.The Eurasian H5 avian influenza in hunter-harvested waterfowl was first detected by Clemson University scientists then confirmed by federal testing, and the federal Agriculture Department alerted global health officials, according to The Associated Press.Previously, the US Department of Agriculture reported an outbreak of a highly pathogenic bird flu strain in a turkey flock in Indiana. This instantly triggered a ban on Indiana poultry from countries like China and Taiwan. Certainly, many more trade restrictions will be put in place and, unfortunately, it's also fairly certain many more cases will soon be discovered. What makes the Indiana discoveries so critical is the state's location within the Mississippi Flyway. Bird flu doesn't originate in commercial poultry flocks but is instead brought to flocks through migratory birds, often through a shared water source. The risk of the pathogen to people is low, but it spreads very quickly through commercial bird populations.In 2015, North Dakota had 2 cases of avian flu affecting over 100 000 birdsThe Bismarck Tribune reports there are 9 turkey farms in North Dakota producing around a million birds annually. But all poultry producers need to be on the lookout for sick birds or a drop in egg production.""As migration takes place this spring, we encourage producers to focus on biosecurity,"" North Dakota State Vet Dr. Ethan Andress said. ""Anyone involved with poultry production from backyard birds to a commercial operation should review and understand how the virus could spread to their birds, and prevent the exposure before it happens.""While the numbers are still small, we're all well aware of how quickly a pandemic can spread. For information about biosecurity measures you can take with your birds along with updates on virus activity across the country see this site: https://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/avian-influenza. [This particular site had some biosecurity tips for every bird producer. - Mod.TG][Byline: Scott McGowan]--Communicated by:ProMED******[2] Delaware (New Castle County) and Maryland (Queen Anne's County): commercial flocks, HPAI H5N1Date: Wed 9 Mar 2022Source: Delaware.gov, Department of Agriculture [edited]https://news.delaware.gov/2022/03/09/two-additional-cases-of-avian-influenza-confirmed-on-delaware-and-maryland-farms/Federal laboratory testing has confirmed 2 cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI): 1 pullet operation in New Castle County, Delaware, and 1 broiler flock in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. Following an investigation by the Delaware and Maryland departments of agriculture, the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed poultry from these farms have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI).These avian influenza findings follow previously announced cases on farms in New Castle County, Delaware, and Cecil County, Maryland. Following these cases, federal and state partners have greatly expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen to better protect the poultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula.State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.Considering these new cases and the prevalence of the virus in the wild bird population, all poultry owners need to increase their vigilance in protecting their flocks from contracting avian influenza.Key biosecurity practices:- Clean and disinfect vehicles. Don't walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can't avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock. This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wildfowl, such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station.- Remove loose feed. Don't give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch! Remove spilled or uneaten feed immediately, and ensure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI.- Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds, including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles.- Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry. Wash with soap and water (always your 1st choice). If using a hand sanitizer, remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands, because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt.- Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud, or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush before stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean.- Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property. When handling birds, visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear. Shower out and change clothes when leaving the facility.- Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment (e.g., egg flats and cases) that have come in contact with birds or their droppings to exit the property, ensure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected, such as cardboard egg flats.- Look for signs of illness. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases.If you have sick poultry or experience increased mortality in your flock:- Commercial poultry producers should follow the procedures of contacting the company they grow for when they notice signs of disease.- Backyard flock owners who notice any of the signs of HPAI in their flock should contact the following:In Delaware, email the Delaware Poultry Health Hotline at <poultry.health@delaware.gov> or call 302-698-4507 and provide your contact information, size of flock, location, and concerns.In Maryland, report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to <MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov.>.--Communicated by:ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi******[3] Delaware, Maryland, Missouri: commercial flocks, HPAI H5N1Date: Thu 10 Mar 2022Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/three-states-report-more-avian-flu-outbreaks-poultryDelaware, Maryland, and Missouri reported more highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks at commercial poultry farms, part of ongoing activity over the past several weeks that has led to the loss of nearly 3 million chickens and turkeys.Also, federal officials reported 50 more highly pathogenic H5 detections from testing in wild birds, including the 1st in waterfowl in Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.Delaware reported a 2nd outbreak in New Castle County, near Wilmington on the Delaware Bay, which was confirmed on 8 Mar [2022] and affected 265 000 pullet chickens, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS).In neighboring Maryland, the state also reported a 2nd outbreak, this time at a broiler flock of 150 000 birds in Queen Anne's County in the eastern half of the state, according to the USDA. A joint statement from the agriculture departments in Delaware and Maryland said the outbreaks involve H5N1. They added that state and federal officials have dramatically expanded surveillance to protect poultry in the Delmarva Peninsula.The Delmarva Peninsula poultry production area also includes Virginia's eastern shore. The Delmarva Chicken Association said about 12% of the nation's poultry supply comes from the area and that the recent outbreaks are the region's 1st since 2004. It noted that the 2 earlier outbreaks in Delaware and Maryland involved layer farms.Elsewhere, Missouri reported 2 more outbreaks in addition to earlier detections in Bates County (backyard poultry) and Stoddard County (commercial chickens). In an update, the Missouri Department of Agriculture said the virus struck a turkey farm housing 27 000 birds in Jasper Country and a commercial poultry farm housing 37 770 in Lawrence County. Both locations are in southwestern Missouri.In other avian flu developments, APHIS reported 50 more highly pathogenic H5 detections from wild bird sampling, including the 1st in waterfowl in Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, raising the total to 357 from 20 states.Indiana's positive sample was from a wild duck harvested by a hunter in Dubois County, which had already reported outbreaks on turkey farms. Kansas has 5 detections, all involving hunter-harvested snow geese in Barton County, which is in the central part of the state.Meanwhile, Missouri had 22 detections, all involving hunter-harvested birds and mostly in snow geese. One was in Buchanan County in the northwest, while the others were in Chariton County, located in the north central part of the state. Nebraska's detection was in a wild goose found dead in Lancaster County, in the southeastern part of the state near Lincoln.The other detections were in states where testing had already found the virus in waterfowl or other birds: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Most of the birds were tested after they were found dead.The outbreaks in wild birds and poultry involve the Eurasian H5N1 strain that is circulating in a number of world regions, including Europe, where the virus has caused substantial poultry losses. The virus has also sickened one person in the United Kingdom who had close contact with poultry. The risk to humans is thought to be low, except for people who have close contact with sick birds.Monitoring is underway in the United States in people exposed to the affected flocks, and so far, no illnesses have been reported.[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]--Communicated by:Mary Marshall<mjm2020@googlemail.com>******[4] Iowa (Taylor County): commercial flockDate: Fri 11 Mar 2022Source: Iowa Capital Dispatch [edited]https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/03/11/bird-flu-detected-in-flock-of-918000-iowa-hens/A large commercial flock of egg-laying chickens in southwest Iowa is the 3rd to be infected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.The Taylor County flock has 918 873 birds, said Chloe Carson, a spokesperson for the department.Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation Friday [11 Mar 2022] for the county to ensure enough state resources are available to assist the disinfection of the site. Lab tests identified the virus on Thursday [10 Mar 2022], and state agriculture officials have said they attempt to cull all the birds of infected flocks within 24 hours of the virus' confirmation.The virus is very contagious and often deadly to domestic birds.""While this additional case of HPAI is not unexpected, we have prepared for this and are working closely with USDA and livestock producers to control and eradicate this disease from our state,"" said Mike Naig, the state's secretary of agriculture. ""This is a difficult time for poultry producers. We will continue to support them and emphasize the need for strict biosecurity on farms and around poultry to help prevent the spread of this disease.""It was previously found in Iowa in a flock of 50 000 commercial turkeys on 6 Mar [2022] in Buena Vista County and in a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks in Pottawattamie County on 1 Mar [2022].State Veterinarian Jeff Kaisand has said the likely source of infections of the previous flocks were wild birds carrying the virus without showing signs.The Taylor County flock is the 2nd-largest to be infected by the virus in the country this year [2022], according to the US Department of Agriculture.An outbreak in 2015 led to the culling of more than 30 million birds in Iowa.[Byline: Jared Strong]--Communicated by:ProMED******[5] Illinois (Will and McLean counties) and Kansas (Franklin County): backyard flocksDate: Sat 12 Mar 2022Source: USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) [edited]https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-ks-ilThe United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a backyard mixed species poultry flock in Franklin County, Kansas, and a non-commercial backyard flock (non-poultry) in Mclean County, Illinois.Samples from the Kansas flock were tested at the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and samples from the Illinois flock were tested at the University of Illinois Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Both laboratories are part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The samples were confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in both states on joint incident responses. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg F] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. OIE trade guidelines also call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notifications in non-poultry.APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.Additional backgroundAvian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus, which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or ""H"" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or ""N"" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of ""H"" and ""N"" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.Contacts:<APHISpress@usda.gov>--Communicated by:ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud OrabiandMary Marshall<mjm2020@googlemail.com>******[6] Wisconsin (Jefferson County): commercial poultryDate: Mon 14 Mar 2022Source ABC News [edited]https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/bird-flu-case-found-southern-wisconsin-chicken-flock-83441849The bird flu has been confirmed in a commercial chicken operation in Wisconsin, the US Department of Agriculture announced Monday [14 Mar 2022].Samples from the flock were tested at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and confirmed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, the agency said in a statement.State animal health officials have quarantined the property in southern Wisconsin's Jefferson County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Milwaukee. All chickens in the flock will be destroyed and will not enter the food system, the USDA said.Farms raising turkeys and chickens for consumption have been on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity since avian influenza was recently discovered in a handful of states, including Indiana and Iowa. Producers fear a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus spreading easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the recent bird flu detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.--Communicated by:ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi[This is a most unfortunate situation. Every person with birds needs to be on high alert. Protect your birds by keeping them inside if you can. Be extra cautious about who comes into contact with our birds; have them change coveralls and boots and blow their noses before entering the bird barn.The same is true if you are a small or backyard producer: be cautious of who comes near your birds.

The government ordered the cull of some 3.5 million birds, mostly ducks, in its southwest region.--Communicated by:ProMED******[2] Pre-emptive culling, VendéeDate: Fri 11 Mar 2022Source: The Local [edited]https://www.thelocal.fr/20220311/france-to-cull-millions-more-poultry-as-bird-flu-flares/France will drastically step up the culling of chickens, ducks and other poultry to contain a bird flu outbreak worse than last winter's, the agriculture ministry said on Friday [11 Mar 2022].It is the 4th major flu epidemic for French poultry farms since 2015, mainly in the country's southwest, home to the lucrative yet controversial foie gras liver pate.By wiping out the populations where the virus is spreading, officials hope to shorten the outbreak and prevent it from reaching other poultry-raising regions.Over 4 million birds had already been culled this year [2022] before the outbreak spread to western France over the past 2 weeks, especially the Vendée department along the Atlantic coast.The Vendée is considered ""strategic"" by the ministry because many farms raise birds exclusively for breeding, so clearing the latest virus from the zone is key ""for a recovery of activities once it has been sanitised.""Nearly 190 infected sites have been detected in the department, up from just 74 on Sunday [6 Mar 2022], the ministry said.""We estimate there are still 3 million animals that must be culled"" in the region, the ministry said.So far, 611 infected sites have been detected overall, surpassing the outbreak of last year [2021], when nearly 500 sites were found requiring the culling of 3.5 million birds.Quarantine measures have been taken against the virus, and farmers are compensated by the government for losses that can reach millions of euros.--Communicated by:ProMED[During the 1st week of March 2022, 59 new outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in commercial poultry in France were reported by OIE. The majority (38) of these 59 outbreaks occurred in commercial duck premises. A further 2 outbreaks have been reported in noncommercial backyard poultry premises; one with 22 geese and one with 3 red junglefowl (_Gallus gallus_). There have also been 2 HPAI H5N1 events reported in wild birds, involving a mute swan (_Cygnus olor_) and a whooper swan (_Cygnus cygnus_). The said details, and a map (no 3), showing the distribution of HPAI H5 outbreaks in poultry and captive birds, and cases in wild birds, in Europe (including the UK), as reported to OIE between September 2021 and 7 Mar 2022, is available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1060076/hpai-europe-220307.pdf. The map presents flyways of the wild birds. The continuously updated HPAI data from EU's reference laboratory for avian influenza (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, IZSVe), based upon information from 31 European countries (UK not included), presents a graphic with weekly totals of the HPAI events, as identified in 3 categories (poultry, captive birds, wild birds). The epizootic peaked during the 2nd week of 2022, after which a weekly decrease is apparent. The said website presents also a table including all HPAI-positive events (poultry, captive and wild birds) reported between 8 Oct 2021 and 11 Mar 2022; see at https://www.izsvenezie.com/documents/reference-laboratories/avian-influenza/europe-updates/HPAI/2021-1/total-events.pdf.According to the table, a total of 1250 outbreaks were reported in poultry farms as of 10 Mar 2022; the 3 leading countries are France (529 outbreaks), Italy (315), and Hungary (113). The total number of confirmed-infected wild birds, in the said countries, is 2003, led by Germany (1083), Netherlands (377) and Denmark (104). - Mod.ASProMED map:France: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701979,100] See Also

All birds in this commercial flock will be destroyed. The confirmation came from a poultry flock in Charles Mix County in southeastern South Dakota along the Missouri River. The river is of course a major flyway for spring bird migration. South Dakota now joins Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, the Carolinas, and Maryland as states confirming HPAI infection.""I think it's not a matter of if it comes to Minnesota -- it's when,"" so says Minnesota Board of Animal Health senior veterinarian Shauna Voss. It's only been 7 years since around 9 million birds across 110 Minnesota farms were killed by avian influenza or were euthanized to prevent the spread. The economic impact on producers was nothing short of catastrophic. Now in 2022, avian influenza has been detected in the United States. Earlier this year [2022] it was first discovered in birds in the Carolinas.The Eurasian H5 avian influenza in hunter-harvested waterfowl was first detected by Clemson University scientists then confirmed by federal testing, and the federal Agriculture Department alerted global health officials, according to The Associated Press.Previously, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported an outbreak of a highly pathogenic bird flu strain in a turkey flock in Indiana. This instantly triggered a ban on Indiana poultry from countries like China and Taiwan. Certainly, many more trade restrictions will be put in place and unfortunately, it's also fairly certain many more cases will soon be discovered. What makes the Indiana discoveries so critical is the state's location within the Mississippi Flyway. Bird flu doesn't originate in commercial poultry flocks but is instead brought to flocks through migratory birds often through a shared water source. The risk of the pathogen to people is low but it spreads very quickly through commercial bird populations.In 2015 North Dakota had 2 cases of avian flu affecting over 100 000 birds.The Bismarck Tribune reports there are 9 turkey farms in North Dakota producing around a million birds annually. But all poultry producers need to be on the lookout for sick birds or a drop in egg production.""As migration takes place this spring, we encourage producers to focus on biosecurity,"" North Dakota State Vet Dr. Ethan Andress said. ""Anyone involved with poultry production from backyard birds to a commercial operation should review and understand how the virus could spread to their birds, and prevent the exposure before it happens.""While the numbers are still small, we're all well aware of how quickly a pandemic can spread. For information about biosecurity measures you can take with your birds along with updates on virus activity across the country see this site: https://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/avian-influenza. [This particular site has some biosecurity tips for every bird producers. - Mod.TG][Byline: Scott McGowan]--Communicated by:ProMED******[2] Delaware (New Castle County) and Maryland (Queen Anne's County): commercial flocksDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022Source: Delaware Government [edited]https://news.delaware.gov/2022/03/09/two-additional-cases-of-avian-influenza-confirmed-on-delaware-and-maryland-farms/Federal laboratory testing has confirmed 2 cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) -- 1 pullet operation in New Castle County, Delaware, and 1 broiler flock in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. Following an investigation by the Delaware and Maryland Departments of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed poultry from these farms have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI).These avian influenza findings follow previously announced cases on farms in New Castle County, Delaware, and Cecil County, Maryland. Following these cases, federal and state partners have greatly expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen to better protect the poultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula.State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.Considering these new cases and the prevalence of the virus in the wild bird population, all poultry owners need to increase their vigilance in protecting their flocks from contracting avian influenza.Key biosecurity practices:• Clean and disinfect vehicles. Don't walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can't avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock. This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wildfowl, such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station.• Remove loose feed. Don't give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch! Remove spilled or uneaten feed immediately and ensure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI.• Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds, including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles.• Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry. Wash with soap and water (always your 1st choice). If using a hand sanitizer, remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt.• Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud, or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush BEFORE stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean.• Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property. When handling birds, visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear. Shower out and change clothes when leaving the facility.• Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment (e.g., egg flats and cases) that have come in contact with birds or their droppings to exit the property, ensure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected, such as cardboard egg flats.• Look for signs of illness. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases.If you have sick poultry or experience increased mortality in your flock:• Commercial poultry producers should follow the procedures of contacting the company they grow for when they notice signs of disease.• Backyard flock owners who notice any of the signs of HPAI in their flock should contact: - in Delaware, email the Delaware Poultry Health Hotline at <poultry.health@delaware.gov> or call 302-698-4507 and provide your contact information, size of flock, location, and concerns. - In Maryland, report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to <MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov>.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>******[3] Delaware, Maryland, Missouri: commercial flocksDate: Thu 10 Mar 2022Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/three-states-report-more-avian-flu-outbreaks-poultryDelaware, Maryland, and Missouri reported more highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks at commercial poultry farms, part of ongoing activity over the past several weeks that has led to the loss of nearly 3 million chickens and turkeys.Also, federal officials reported 50 more highly pathogenic H5 detections from testing in wild birds, including the 1st in waterfowl in Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.Delaware reported a 2nd outbreak in New Castle County, near Wilmington on the Delaware Bay, which was confirmed on [8 Mar 2022] and affected 265 000 pullet chickens, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS).In neighboring Maryland, the state also reported a second outbreak, this time at a broiler flock of 150 000 birds in Queen Anne's County in the eastern half of the state, according to the USDA. A joint statement from the agriculture departments in Delaware and Maryland said the outbreaks involve H5N1. They added that state and federal officials have dramatically expanded surveillance to protect poultry in the Delmarva Peninsula.The Delmarva Peninsula poultry production area also includes Virginia's eastern shore. The Delmarva Chicken Association said about 12% of the nation's poultry supply comes from the area and that the recent outbreaks are the region's first since 2004. It noted that the 2 earlier outbreaks in Delaware and Maryland involved layer farms.Elsewhere, Missouri reported 2 more outbreaks in addition to earlier detections in Bates County (backyard poultry) and Stoddard County (commercial chickens). In an update, the Missouri Department of Agriculture said the virus struck a turkey farm housing 27 000 birds in Jasper Country and a commercial poultry farm housing 37 770 in Lawrence County. Both locations are in southwestern Missouri.In other avian flu developments, APHIS reported 50 more highly pathogenic H5 detections from wild bird sampling, including the first in waterfowl in Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, raising the total to 357 from 20 states.Indiana's positive sample was from a wild duck harvested by a hunter in Dubois County, which had already reported outbreaks on turkey farms. Kansas has 5 detections, all involving hunter-harvested snow geese in Barton County, which is in the central part of the state.Meanwhile, Missouri had 22 detections, all involving hunter-harvested birds and mostly in snow geese. One was in Buchanan County in the northwest, while the others were in Chariton County, located in the north central part of the state. Nebraska's detection was in a wild goose found dead in Lancaster County, in the southeastern part of the state near Lincoln.The other detections were in states where testing had already found the virus in waterfowl or other birds: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Most of the birds were tested after they were found dead.The outbreaks in wild birds and poultry involve the Eurasian H5N1 strain that is circulating in a number of world regions, including Europe, where the virus has caused substantial poultry losses. The virus has also sickened one person in the United Kingdom who had close contact with poultry. The risk to humans is thought to be low, except for people who have close contact with sick birds.Monitoring is under way in the United States in people exposed to the affected flocks, and so far, no illnesses have been reported.[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]--Communicated by:Mary Marshall <mjm2020@googlemail.com>******[4] Iowa (Taylor County): commercial flockDate: Fri 11 Mar 2022Source: Iowa Capital Dispatch [edited]https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/03/11/bird-flu-detected-in-flock-of-918000-iowa-hens/A large commercial flock of egg-laying chickens in southwest Iowa is the 3rd to be infected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.The Taylor County flock has 918 873 birds, said Chloe Carson, a spokesperson for the department.Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation Friday [11 Mar 2022] for the county to ensure enough state resources are available to assist the disinfection of the site. Lab tests identified the virus on Thursday [10 Mar 2022], and state agriculture officials have said they attempt to cull all the birds of infected flocks within 24 hours of the virus' confirmation.The virus is very contagious and often deadly to domestic birds.""While this additional case of HPAI is not unexpected, we have prepared for this and are working closely with USDA and livestock producers to control and eradicate this disease from our state,"" said Mike Naig, the state's secretary of agriculture. ""This is a difficult time for poultry producers. We will continue to support them and emphasize the need for strict biosecurity on farms and around poultry to help prevent the spread of this disease.""It was previously found in Iowa in a flock of 50 000 commercial turkeys on [6 Mar 2022] in Buena Vista County and in a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks in Pottawattamie County on [1 Mar 2022].State Veterinarian Jeff Kaisand has said the likely source of infections of the previous flocks were wild birds carrying the virus without showing signs.The Taylor County flock is the 2nd-largest to be infected by the virus in the country this year [2022], according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.An outbreak in 2015 led to the culling of more than 30 million birds in Iowa.[Byline: Jared Strong]--Communicated by:ProMED******[5] Kansas (Franklin County) and Illinois (McLean County): non-commercial flocksDate: Sat 12 Mar 2022Source: APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) [edited]https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-ks-ilThe United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a backyard mixed species poultry flock in Franklin County, Kansas and a non-commercial backyard flock (non-poultry) in Mclean County, Illinois.Samples from the Kansas flock were tested at the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and samples from the Illinois flock were tested at the University of Illinois Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Both laboratories are part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The samples were confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in both states on joint incident responses. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://bit.ly/3I6Xcdz.USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. OIE trade guidelines also call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notifications in non-poultry.APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a State but will not announce subsequent detections in the State. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors, when possible, to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.Additional background:Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or ""H"" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or ""N"" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of ""H"" and ""N"" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains which circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high) -- the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[Be cautious of where you visit. Visiting a poultry house, or a pond where birds are means you could track the virus back to your birds. Avian influenza not only flies into an area on wild birds but can be tracked from location to location by people and vehicles. Guard your birds in every way possible. Increase your biosecurity by simple things like changing footwear and coveralls, and instituting foot baths prior to entering a barn. Blow your nose and deposit the tissue in a sealed trash reciprocal, and repeat the process when leaving the barn. If you can keep your birds inside and away from wild birds and visitors, this would be best. This virus continues to cause havoc in poultry of all types, and commercial and private flocks. - Mod.TGProMED maps:South Dakota, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,243Delaware, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,211Maryland, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,223Missouri, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,227Iowa, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,218Kansas, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,219Illinois, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,67949] See Also

She developed symptoms on 17 Nov 2021 and was admitted for treatment on 20 Nov 2021. She passed away on 4 Dec 2021.The 2nd case involves a 79-year-old man living in Liuzhou in Guangxi who had visited a live poultry market before onset. He developed symptoms on 18 Nov 2021 and was admitted for treatment on 22 Nov 2021. He passed away on 3 Dec 2021.From 2014 to date [8 Mar 2022], 73 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities. ""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments. The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel [see source URL above for these web links].--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sharing this update on human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in China.The above report mentions 2 new cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in mainland China, both fatal, increasing the total cases in 2022 to 11 (although these 2 cases can technically be included in the 2021 tally). Accordingly, from 2014 to date, 73 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry such as chickens or ducks. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infections.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBAProMED map:China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701894,155] See Also

This is the state's 1st confirmed case of HPAI since 2015.""While Nebraska has not seen HPAI in a backyard or commercial poultry flock within the state this year [2022], the finding of this single goose adds Nebraska to a long list of states with confirmed cases of HPAI,"" said State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley. ""Infected wild birds can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, so we encourage backyard poultry and commercial poultry flocks to continue to remain vigilant, practice good biosecurity and report sick or dying birds immediately.""The Nebraska Department of Agriculture and the Kansas Department of Agriculture's (KDA) Division of Animal Health encourage poultry owners to take steps to protect their commercial and backyard flocks from avian influenza by monitoring their birds for symptoms and by implementing biosecurity practices.Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys, and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death. HPAI has been identified in backyard flocks as well as commercial operations in neighboring states; it has not been detected in Kansas.""Protecting the poultry in the state is a high priority, and we need all poultry owners to be part of the effort to prevent the spread of disease in Kansas,"" said Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith. ""Our best defense is to follow strict biosecurity practices and vigilantly monitor birds for any signs of illness.""According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk. Poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest avian influenza surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.For more information about HPAI, including current status of the confirmed cases in other states as well as more information about biosecurity for your flock, go to the KDA's avian influenza webpage at <agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza> or call 785-564-6601.--Communicated by:ProMED[ProMED map of Nebraska, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701931,23160Nebraska county map: https://geology.com/county-map/nebraska-county-map.gif]******Canada[3] New Brunswick (Albert County): great black-backed gullDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022 16:05 ASTSource: Global News [edited]https://globalnews.ca/news/8670483/avian-flu-new-brunswick-black-backed-gull/New Brunswick has detected a case of the avian flu in a great black-backed gull in the Riverview area [Albert County]. In a release, the province's Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development said the Canadian Wildlife Service confirmed the bird had tested positive for the highly-pathogenic avian influenza, also known as H5N1.The strain of avian flu, which is a viral infection that can spread easily among birds, has been detected in every Atlantic province.The release said there are several different types of avian influenza. Some wild bird species, like ducks, might carry the virus and infect other birds without getting sick themselves. Meanwhile, other wild or domestic bird species can become severely ill or die after infection.""Although the chances of people getting sick from avian influenza are extremely low, people who work around birds should take extra care,"" the release said.Those who encounter a sick or dead bird should contact the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development at 1-833-301-0334, the release said.[Byline: Alex Cooke]--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED map of New Brunswick, Canada: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701931,17394New Brunswick county map: https://www.123rf.com/photo_23993023_new-brunswick-administrative-map.htmlThe Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 in the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway, although the finding of an infected wild goose in Nebraska shows that the virus is already moving westward.It is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB] See Also

Virus transmission between prey and predators and scavengers has been shown for HPAI virus (H5N1), with reported deaths in crows, birds of prey, and even mammals (carnivores). However, the transmission of avian influenza viruses has not been sustained within predator and scavenger populations, suggesting that these represent dead-end hosts.The white-tailed eagle (_Haliaeetus albicilla_) is a very large species of sea eagle widely distributed across temperate Eurasia. It is not considered threatened.

Birds in 5 commercial facilities and 37 backyard flocks in the quarantined area are being tested.Tests verified the virus in the Buena Vista County flock late Sunday [6 Mar 2022], Kaisand said. The destroyed birds will be disposed of on location, he said. The owner has the option of composting the birds or burying them.On Monday [7 Mar 2022], Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster declaration for the county, allowing the state agriculture department and other agencies to assist with detection, tracking, and monitoring of the disease and containment, disposal, and disinfection.Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said Monday [7 Mar 2022] the outbreak at a commercial facility could have trade implications. The US Department of Agriculture will report the case to global animal health and trade officials and wait to see if any restrictions are placed on Iowa birds.Last week, the Iowa and US agriculture departments said a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks, where bird flu was detected in Pottawattamie County, had been destroyed and incinerated.Kaisand said he believes wild birds infected the turkey facility as they migrate across the US. He sees no connection between the Pottawattamie County and Buena Vista County outbreaks.Agriculture officials also set up a quarantine area in Pottawattamie County, but with just 3 backyard flocks in that zone, officials only required that the birds be monitored for signs of infection.Over the weekend, avian influenza also was discovered in commercial flocks in Maryland, South Dakota, and Missouri, bringing to 12 the states with reported outbreaks detected.Kaisand said poultry producers should put up ""as many firewalls as possible between your poultry and wild birds,"" adding that ""separating any connections between wild birds and domestic birds is absolutely critical this year [2022].""State and federal agencies said none of the birds nor any poultry products from flocks where avian influenza is detected will reach US food supplies. No human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in the United States.The virus' spread is particularly concerning in Iowa, which leads the nation in egg production, with 55 million laying hens, and ranks 7th nationally for turkey production, raising 12 million birds annually.Kaisand said it's important to note that there is no cure or vaccine for bird flu.The virus can wipe out a flock within 48 hours. A 2015 outbreak led to the destruction of 32.7 million laying hens, turkeys, and other birds in Iowa. That was about 2/3 of the 50.5 million that were destroyed nationally in what is considered the worst foreign animal disease outbreak on record.The US Department of Agriculture helps the state and producers get rid of potentially infected birds and disinfect facilities, Naig said. The federal government also will help producers financially with the loss of the birds. ""This is a devastating blow to them economically,"" he said.He said he believes industry and state and federal government officials are better prepared than in 2015, with tighter biosecurity measures limiting access to facilities and preventing contamination of birds' water and feed.""None of us want to be facing a foreign animal disease again here in Iowa, but we have learned a lot,"" Naid said, adding that ""we're ready to respond quickly"" when an outbreak is identified to prevent the virus' spread.Last week, Naig said Iowans with flocks should be ""on high alert"" over the next couple months while wild birds are migrating. The state is part of the Mississippi flyway, a migration route for millions of birds annually.Naig said the discovery of disease in Iowa on 1 Mar [2022] was ""not unexpected,"" given reports it had been detected in wild, backyard, and commercial flocks, mostly in eastern US states.Kaisand urged poultry owners to immediately report to the state and federal agriculture departments any birds that become sick or die unexpectedly.Officials say poultry products remain safe to eat when properly handled and cooked.US Department of Agriculture figures for 2020, the latest available, show Iowa's poultry industry receipts were USD 1.28 billion.[Byline: Donnelle Eller]--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED map of Buena Vista County, Iowa, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701868,3627]******[2] Missouri (Stoddard County): commercial poultryDate: Fri 4 Mar 2022Source: Dexter Statesman [edited]https://www.dexterstatesman.com/story/2937635.htmlStoddard County Health Center Director Ben Godwin stated in a social media release that a flock of broiler chickens in Stoddard County has tested positive for avian influenza (AI). Godwin said the test was confirmed by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).Godwin's release said samples from the flock were tested at the University of Missouri Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network NAHLN, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.The APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in Missouri on a joint incident response to the positive test. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease; birds from the flock will not enter the food system.Godwin said according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern.Godwin said cases of avian influenza in humans is very rare but could cause flu-like symptoms. Additionally, Godwin said no human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.Godwin said everyone should cook all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] to kill bacteria and viruses.As part of the existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in the areas around the affected flock. Godwin's release said the United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations. Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. The APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/.../dtf-resources/dtf-resources.Godwin said the USDA will report these finding to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. He said the USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts.The OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region posing a risk of spreading the disease of concern.Godwin said APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/.../avian-influenza/2022-hpai.According to Godwin's release, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS's toll-free number in addition to practicing good biosecurity.Additionally, the APHIS is urging producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs being depopulated during a disease response.The APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or ""H"" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or ""N"" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of H and N proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.--Communicated by:ProMED[ProMED map of Stoddard County, Missouri, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701868,30006]******[3] Maryland (Cecil County): commercial chickensDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022 5:21 p.m. ESTSource: WBAL TV [edited]https://www.wbaltv.com/article/avian-influenza-flu-commercial-chickens-cecil-county/39334609The presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in a flock of commercial chickens in Cecil County, Maryland, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.Samples from the flock were tested at the University of Delaware's Allen Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced in a statement released Saturday [5 Mar 2021].The USDA said state officials quarantined the affected premises, and action is being taken to prevent the spread of the disease.

Federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock, the USDA said.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.As a reminder, the USDA said the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] kills bacteria and viruses.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED map of Cecil County, Maryland, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701868,20947][Avian influenza continues to move across the United States. Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and if you are a hunter, take notice if there are ill birds in flocks you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds.While most of these articles do not specifically mention H5N1, it is highly likely this is the specific strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza.Migrating birds can transport the virus without the migratory bird appearing to be ill. So this is a time to be very vigilant about all birds near your flock. - Mod.TG] See Also

Five of the cases were in young children and 4 cases had an onset date of 2021. No deaths were reported. In most human cases of H9N2 avian flu, the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.--Communicated by:ProMED[According to the WHO update Number 832 on influenza at the animal-human interface released 18 Feb 2022 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20220107.pdf?sfvrsn=5f006f99_77):""To date, 6 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported to WHO from China with onset of illness in 2022, and a total of 71 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) including 2 deaths (both with underlying conditions) have been reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region since December 2015. The last case was reported from China with onset date of 28 Jan 2022.""Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk of sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing. - Mod.UBAProMED map:China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701796,155] See Also

The remainder of the state is under surveillance.According to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Florida Department of Health as of this writing, No cases of this bird flu have been found in the domestic, backyard, or commercial birds in Florida.Wild birds, particularly water birds, can carry many strains of low pathogenic avian influenza, most of which do not cause disease in domestic poultry.However, when a low pathogenic strain undergoes a mutation and forms a highly pathogenic strain, the mutated strain can cause significant disease in domestic poultry.The HPAI virus is not easily transmissible from birds to humans, but health officials are concerned it could mutate into another form that could spread readily from person to person, triggering a pandemic.No cases of human infections with HPAI have been reported in the United States as of this writing. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) considers the current risk to the public to below.As risk depends on exposure, it is best to not touch sick or dead wild birds. If such instances are necessary, persons handling such wild birds should use personal protective equipment such as protective clothing, rubber boots, gloves, eye protection, and face shields.After handling the bird, these items can be disinfected with a 10% bleach water solution.To keep domestic, backyard, and commercial flocks free of this virus, it is recommended that all poultry (chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, etc.) be housed inside a coop with a solid roof and that steps be taken to prevent wild birds from entering the coop.It is also recommended to limit visits to your coop to only those who regularly handle your poultry. Report sick or dead birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) or your veterinarian.To help in the tracking of HPAI:- Report sick or dead commercial or backyard birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS.gov) or your veterinarian,- Report wild bird mortalities to http://app.myfwc.com/FWRI/AvianMortality/--Communicated by:ProMED[ProMED map of Florida, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701793,212][The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway.It is important to take into account that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB] See Also

Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and if you are a hunter, take notice if there are ill birds in flocks you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds.Migrating birds can transport the virus without the migratory bird appearing to be ill.

State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F (74 deg C) kills bacteria and viruses.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a tool kit, available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to such notifications in non-poultry.APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for non-commercial backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.Additional backgroundAvian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or ""H"" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or ""N"" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of ""H"" and ""N"" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED map of Maine, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701740,222]******[2] Indiana (Green County): turkeysDate: Mon 21 Feb 2022Source: Brownfield Ag News [edited]https://brownfieldagnews.com/news/another-case-of-avian-influenza-detected-in-indiana/Indiana's Board of Animal Health [BOAH] has detected avian influenza at another commercial turkey flock in southwest Indiana. The presumptive-positive case is the 4th farm in Indiana and the 2nd in Greene County to be diagnosed with the virus. Samples are being verified at the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa and should indicate if the virus is the same as the farm diagnosed earlier this month [February 2022] and if the virus is highly pathogenic.Depopulation efforts are underway on the premises. To date, nearly 120 000 commercial turkeys have been depopulated.The site is approximately 5 mi [8 km] from the 1st positive case in Greene County. All commercial poultry farms within the expanded control area will be quarantined and tested regularly until the control area is lifted.Late last week, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2 non-commercial backyard flocks, one in Maine and another in New York. Those flocks on the affected [premises] were depopulated.[Byline: Meghan Grebner]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[ProMED map of Indiana, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701740,217]******[3] Delaware (New Castle County): commercial poultryDate: Wed 23 Feb 2022Source: Delaware.gov [edited]https://news.delaware.gov/2022/02/23/avian-influenza-found-in-delaware-chicken-flock-producers-urged-to-take-precautions/Testing has confirmed a case of avian influenza on a Delaware poultry farm showing increased mortality over the past few days. Following an investigation by the Delaware Department of Agriculture, the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed that poultry from this farm have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI).There is no public health concern, and avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat.""We have taken immediate action to contain this disease and will continue to work with poultry owners, the industry, and our laboratory partners to protect against its spread,"" said Delaware Secretary of Agriculture Michael T. Scuse. ""This appears to be an isolated case, with no reports of disease among our chicken industry. Delmarva poultry is safe to eat, and consumers can be confident in the safety of their food.""The Delaware Department of Agriculture and partner agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture, are working to contain the situation, including sampling and quarantining nearby poultry flocks.Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.The farm is under quarantine to stop the spread of avian influenza to other flocks in the state. The birds on the affected farm will be depopulated to prevent the spread of disease and will not enter the food system. Due to the severity of this avian influenza, anyone found trespassing on a quarantined farm will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.The avian influenza detection was the highly pathogenic H5 type, which is more severe and can cause high mortality in poultry flocks. It is the same strain confirmed in other states and wild birds in the Atlantic flyway.It is not known exactly how the virus was contracted. Scuse encouraged all poultry flock owners to follow the strictest biosecurity on their farms to prevent the spread of the disease. Those steps include the following:- Limit, monitor, and record any movement of people, vehicles, or animals on or off your farm.- Permit only essential workers and vehicles to enter the farm to limit the chances of bringing the virus from an outside source.- Avoid visiting other poultry farms and any unnecessary travel off the farm.- Disinfect equipment, vehicles, footwear, and other items coming into contact with flocks.- Keep your flock away from wild or migratory birds, especially waterfowl.- Isolate any ill animals and contact your veterinarian.This finding is the 1st case of HPAI in commercial poultry in Delaware since 2004.Positive test results were confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Service Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. Preliminary testing was performed at the University of Delaware's Allen Laboratory in Newark, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.For more information on avian influenza and protecting poultry, visit https://de.gov/poultry. Backyard flock owners who have sick or unusual deaths in their flocks should email <Poultry.Health@delaware.gov> or call the Delaware poultry line.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED map of Delaware, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701740,211]******[4] Michigan (Kalamazoo County): backyard flockDate: Thu 24 Feb 2022Source: Michigan.gov [edited]https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/about/media/pressreleases/2022/02/24/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-detected-in-michigan-backyard-flockFollowing an investigation by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD), the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) has confirmed the discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard flock in Kalamazoo County. This detection shows that the virus is present in the environment and highlights the need for poultry owners to protect their flocks by increasing biosecurity.After several birds from the affected flock died and others showed signs of illness, samples were sent to the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (MSU VDL) for testing. The results from MSU VDL were then confirmed by NVSL.""MDARD is always preparing for situations like this when they arise, which is why we were able to take quick action to contain this disease and help protect against its spread,"" said MDARD Director Gary McDowell. ""At this time, this is an isolated case. There is no threat to public health or food safety. We do not anticipate any disruptions to supply chains across our state. As this situation develops, we will continue to work with our partners at local and federal levels to best mitigate spread and provide outreach.""To protect other flocks in Michigan, the premises is currently under quarantine, and the birds have been depopulated to prevent further disease spread.Fortunately, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. Also, no birds or bird products infected with HPAI will enter the food chain. As a reminder, all poultry and eggs should be handled and cooked properly.""Now, with HPAI present in Michigan, it is critical for poultry owners to increase biosecurity measures and to keep wild birds out in order to protect their flocks. Increasing those measures will be important to ensure domestic birds are kept healthy and safe,"" said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland. ""Simply put, no matter how many birds or which type of birds someone owns, now is the time to protect them. I'm asking all owners to sign up for our email alerts so we can provide them with critical updates on this developing situation.""Whether you have a few backyard birds or a large commercial flock, following these biosecurity measures can help protect Michigan's domestic birds:- Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.- Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.- Disinfect boots and other gear when moving between coops.- Don't share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.- Clean and disinfect equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.- Use well water or municipal water as drinking water for birds.- Keep poultry feed secure so there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.Poultry owners and caretakers should watch for unusual deaths, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected, contact MDARD immediately, even if after regular business hours.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED map of Michigan, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701740,225][Avian influenza is on the move. It continues to move across the United States. Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and notice if there are ill birds in flocks you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds. - Mod.TG] See Also

""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel [see source URL for weblinks to these pages].--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sharing this update on human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in China.The above report mentions 4 new cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in mainland China including one death, bumping the total cases in 2022 to 9. From 2014 to date, 71 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g., chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death.People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBAProMED map:China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701722,155] See Also

While bird flu can be spread to humans, there has not been a transmission to humans in the US.""We have taken immediate action to contain this disease and will continue to work with poultry owners, the industry, and our laboratory partners to protect against its spread,"" said Delaware Secretary of Agriculture Michael T Scuse in the press release. ""This appears to be an isolated case, with no reports of disease among our chicken industry. Delmarva poultry is safe to eat, and consumers can be confident in the safety of their food.""The Delaware Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Agriculture will increase sampling and quarantining nearby poultry flocks.Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure, the state said. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.The farm is under quarantine to stop the spread. The birds on the affected farm will be killed to prevent the spread of disease, the state said.In addition, because of the severity of this avian influenza, anyone found trespassing on a quarantined farm will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, the state said.The highly contagious H5 type of influenza, which is more severe and can cause high mortality in poultry flocks, is the same strain confirmed in other states and wild birds in the Atlantic flyway.It is not known exactly how the virus was contracted, the state press release said.--Communicated by:ProMED[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread.

Several factors can influence it, such as the wild bird migration pattern, unregulated trade, farming systems, biosecurity, and immunity status.""During the Northern Hemisphere winter, the wild bird movements may increase, and lower temperatures may facilitate the environmental survival of AI viruses, increasing exposure of infection in poultry. Additionally, the mixing of wild birds from different geographic origins during migration can increase the risk of virus spread and genetic reassortment resulting in changes in viral properties. At local level, as the AI viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, they can be easily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of infected animals, as well as contaminated boots, vehicles and equipment if the adequate biosecurity measures are not implemented.""(Source: OIE Avian Influenza Portal - Question and Answers section https://www.oie.int/en/disease/avian-influenza/#ui-id-2)A map of avian influenza in Europe observed since 1 Oct 2021 (current wave) and as of 21 Feb 2022 is available at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_EU/2022/Map_AI_EU_2022-02-21.jpg. - Mod.CRDProMED map of Republic of Macedonia (FYROM): https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701594,76] See Also

The size of the flock was not disclosed, nor were the species involved.This latest case follows confirmed detections of the same strain of HPAI in Newfoundland and Labrador and more recently in wild birds, a backyard flock, and a commercial turkey farm in Nova Scotia, where 11 800 turkeys were affected.To control any potential spread of the disease, the CFIA has imposed movement restrictions and is recommending enhanced biosecurity for other farms within the area.At this time, some countries have applied temporary import restrictions with variable implications on products and regions in Canada, primarily limited to the export of some poultry products from Nova Scotia.Affected producers and industry associations, as well as federal and provincial departments, are cooperating in the ongoing investigation with a common goal to protect human health, protect the health of Canadian poultry and, in the process, maintain market access for Canadian poultry products.CFIA announced the latest case of HPAI on the same day the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced the virus had been detected in a commercial broiler flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, and a backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia.An earlier case of HPAI was confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana. In that flock, 29 000 turkeys were affected.Also, HPAI has been confirmed in wild birds in New Hampshire, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida.[Byline: Roy Graber]--Communicated by:ProMED******[2] USA: Indiana (Dubois County) commercial turkeysDate: Tue 15 Feb 2022Source: Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) [edited]https://www.in.gov/boah/files/SitUpdate3-2-15-22.pdfOffice of the State VeterinarianSituation update: #3 15 Feb 2022State of Indiana response to highly pathogenic avian influenza in Dubois County-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Current situation:Laboratory testing of a commercial flock of young turkeys in Dubois County has identified the H5 avian influenza virus. This is considered a presumptive positive case, and samples are being verified at the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Iowa. This is the 2nd farm (known as Dubois2) in Indiana to be diagnosed with avian influenza. Pending test results should indicate if the virus is the same as the index farm diagnosed on [9 Feb 2022] and if the virus is highly pathogenic.The close proximity of the 2nd farm to the index site (Dubois1) means the established 10 km [6.2 mi] control area will remain the same.The Dubois2 flock was tested after the owner noticed water consumption by the birds dropped dramatically (a clinical sign of avian influenza). The farm, already under quarantine, houses 26 473 birds.The control area circle is primarily in Dubois County and a portion of northern Spencer County. All commercial poultry flocks (18 total) within the control area are under quarantine for the duration of this event (i.e., until the control area is lifted).Poultry farms in the control area have completed the 1st round of surveillance testing for HPAI to ensure the virus is not present in the area beyond the index farm. Testing of the control area farms will continue on a weekly basis.BOAH has established a surveillance zone around the control area to allow for additional monitoring for the presence of the virus in commercial poultry in the area. The zone extends an additional 10 km [6.2 mi] beyond the control area boundary. Commercial poultry operations in the surveillance zone are not under quarantine but will be tested regularly (at less-frequent intervals) until the control area is lifted.BOAH staff continue to reach out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the control area to schedule testing of birds to ensure the virus is not present. To date, 25 hobby flocks have been sampled; laboratory testing is not yet complete. Hobby poultry owners in Southern Dubois County should contact BOAH.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>******[3] USA: Indiana (Greene County) commercial turkeysDate: Thu 17 Feb 2022Source: 93.1FM WIBC [edited]https://www.wibc.com/news/local-indiana/greene-county-turkey-farm-tests-positive-for-h5-avian-flu/The H5 avian flu outbreak began in Dubois County. Now a farm in another county has had a flu outbreak.The Indiana Board of Animal Health confirms one turkey farm in Greene County tested positive for the same H5 avian flu infecting the farms in Dubois. Greene County is about 60 mi [97 km] north of Dubois. Denise Spears, public information director for the Indiana State Board of Animal Health, says the farms are not related.Spears explains to WIBC News, ""To our knowledge, these farms are not related in any way as far as their production practices go. So it's not what's suspected.""The board was informed by a veterinarian working with the Greene County farm that geese were in the area. Spears says geese could be the suspect behind this poultry problem.""[And] we do know the H5N1 virus is carried by wild migratory waterfowl,"" Spears explains, ""so it wouldn't be uncommon for this to be the source of bringing the virus onto a farm.""Spears says this virus is a challenging issue because the virus simply shouldn't be in Indiana, or the country, for that matter. It has to come from somewhere else.Spears explains, ""It's considered a foreign animal disease to us here in the United States, when we get a highly pathogenic version of the virus. So it's why we have to take such drastic action about it because this is not something that should be here.""Spears says the Board of Animal Health will set up essentially the same operation in Greene County as in Dubois. A 10 km [6.2 mi] zone has been established around the infected farm. All commercial poultry farms in the zone will go through a thorough cleaning process and remain under quarantine for several weeks. Over 60 000 birds at the infected farm have been ""depopulated."" That now brings the total number of infected turkeys to over 100 000.As for the quarantined Dubois County farms, it's business as usual.""It's going very well there,"" says Spears. ""Tests continue to keep happening at the commercial poultry flocks in the county, as well as some backyard hobby flocks. So far, all of those have come back negative, which has made us very happy.""She once again stresses the fact this flu outbreak does not mean anything for the meat and eggs in your home.""This is not a food safety issue; your eggs, your poultry, your chicken and turkey meat are all safe to eat. This virus is not spread that way, so don't be concerned in that way,"" explains Spears.[Byline: Donnie Burgess]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts******[4] USA: Georgia, Connecticut, wild birdsDate: Fri 18 Feb 2022Source: WATTPoultry.com [edited]https://www.wattagnet.com/articles/44554-avian-flu-confirmed-in-georgia-connecticut-wild-birdsThe presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in 2 new states, including the nation's largest poultry-producing state.According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) website, new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been discovered in Georgia and Connecticut. Additional cases have also emerged this week in North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and New Hampshire.All of the new cases involve a Eurasian H5 lineage of the virus.In Georgia, which, according to the USDA, is the nation's largest poultry producer, there have been 2 confirmed cases in hunter-harvested birds. One was a gadwall, and the other was an American widgeon. Both cases were confirmed in Hart County.In Connecticut, there were 21 confirmed cases, all of which were in mallards. All but one of those cases were in Middlesex County, while the other was in New London County.The most recent case in Virginia was found in a hunter-harvested gadwall, with Virginia Beach listed as the location. Three other cases were previously reported in the state.Twenty-nine new cases of HPAI were detected in mallards in New Hampshire, all of which were in Rockingham County. This brings the state's total case count to 49.Delaware has 5 new cases, all in Kent County. The cases involved hunter-harvested birds: 3 northern shovelers, 1 American black duck, and 1 gadwall.North Carolina remains the state with the most cases in wild birds, with 50 being reported within the past week in a variety of duck species. Counties where the virus was detected include Pamlico, Hyde, Currituck, Craven, Beaufort, and Bladen.With these latest detections, HPAI has been confirmed in 11 states in 2022. Those states are Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Delaware, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida. The only 2 states to have confirmed cases in commercial poultry are Indiana, with 2 turkey flocks affected, and Kentucky, with one broiler flock affected.[Byline: Roy Graber]--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>******[5] USA: New York (Suffolk County) backyard flock[A]Date: Sat 19 Feb 2022Source: ABC7NY [edited]https://abc7ny.com/bird-flu-poultry-farmers-hpai-h5n1/11580817/New York poultry farmers are asked to be on alert for a highly pathogenic avian influenza after it was detected in a small flock in Suffolk County.According to a release from the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, was found among 8 birds, part of a non-commercial backyard flock.Officials said samples from the flock were tested at 2 different laboratories.The affected premises have been quarantined, and the remaining birds were to be ""depopulated"" to prevent the spread of the disease. Vermonters who raise turkeys or chickens are asked to be on alert for a highly pathogenic avian influenza after it was detected in some domestic flocks and wild birds in other states.The virus has been detected at 2 commercial turkey farms in southern Indiana, a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia.In 2015, a widespread bird flu outbreak killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly USD 1 billion.The strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus. It has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the 1st US case was identified.US surveillance efforts have identified the virus in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, and South Carolina.Anyone involved with poultry production should review their biosecurity activities to ensure the health of their birds, restrict human movement onto the farm, and limit contact with poultry to only those who need to be there.Bird owners should also prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state or federal officials.Health officials say no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the US, and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern.--Communicated by:ProMED---[B]Date: Sat 19 Feb 2022Source: APHIS [edited]https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-nyThe United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard flock (non-poultry) in Suffolk County, New York.Samples from the flock were tested at the Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in New York on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] kills bacteria and viruses.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to such notifications in non-poultry.APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors, when possible, to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for non-commercial backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus, which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin, or ""H"" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or ""N"" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of ""H"" and ""N"" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[Avian influenza is on the move. It continues to move across the United States. Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and notice if there are ill birds in flocks that you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage, or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds. - Mod.TGProMED maps:Nova Scotia Province, Canada: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701557,271Dubois County, Indiana, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701557,38367Greene County, Indiana, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701557,24956Hart County, Georgia, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701557,23749Connecticut, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701557,210Suffolk County, New York, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701557,4345] See Also

The seal was found dead on a beach on Southwest Funen in September 2021 and examined at the Center for Diagnostics at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) as part of the disease monitoring of fallen game.The seal was emaciated with pronounced skin changes on large parts of the body of uncertain significance and cause. Influenza virus was detected in the lung, but otherwise no other disease-causing organisms could be detected that could explain why the seal was dead.The Center for Diagnostics at DTU has stated that they examined 29 harbor seals and 15 gray seals in 2021, of which only this one was positive for influenza virus.Upon further investigation at the Danish Veterinary Consortium, the virus turned out to be highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] virus of the subtype H5N8.The detected virus is closely related to the viruses that have been the cause of bird flu outbreaks in wild birds and domestic poultry since the autumn of 2020, both here and in the rest of Europe.Seals are known to be susceptible to avian influenza virus.In recent seasons with avian influenza in birds, the discovery of HPAI in wild mammals has been increasingly reported, including seals and wild foxes in northern Europe. These findings have been seen primarily in animals with neurological symptoms, or found dead.When mammals are infected with viruses from birds, there is a risk that the virus will mutate and adapt to its new host species and mammals in general. The Danish Veterinary Consortium has performed a detailed analysis of the virus genome from the wild seal and found some mutations in the virus that show signs of possible adaptation to mammals, although it was not possible to analyze the full genome due to the quality of the material.--Communicated by:ProMED[The original announcement of SSI, published 17 Feb 2022, is available at https://tinyurl.com/y5pd4553 (in Danish). It includes a picture of the infected animal, and the following additional commentary: ""Denmark was hit by a serious outbreak of HPAI, which stretched from autumn 2020 to July 2021, infecting 16 poultry flocks and more than 300 wild birds.""HPAI has been detected again in wild birds and in poultry flocks since the beginning of [the current season, starting] November 2021. New cases are still detected in wild birds every week. So far, a total of 10 flocks have been hit this season, the latest just a few days ago.""Viruses in both seasons are related and belong to the variant of HPAI H5 called clade 2.3.4.4b. While primarily viruses with the H5N8 subtype were found last season, during the current season H5N1 is by far the predominant substrain"".According to the weekly-updated report from EU's reference laboratory for avian influenza (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, IZSVe), based upon information from 31 European countries, the current HPAI H5N1 epizootic has peaked during the second week of 2022, after which a distinct weekly decrease is apparent. The current data relate to HPAI positive events recorded in wild birds, captive birds and poultry between 8 Oct 2021 and 17 Feb 2022 (https://www.izsvenezie.com/documents/reference-laboratories/avian-influenza/europe-updates/HPAI/2021-1/total-events.pdf).A table presenting each of the outbreaks in poultry and cases in wild birds during the said period is available at https://bit.ly/36qXZJb. - Mod.ASProMED map:Denmark: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701556,111] See Also

Given recent reports from West and Southern Africa detecting the virus in Great White Pelicans and coastal birds respectively, the risk of HPAI introduction into other African countries and outbreaks in wild bird populations is regarded as high. Countries should have in place enhanced measures for early detection, diagnosis and outbreak response, in both wild birds and poultry. Context-------On 25 Jan 2022, Senegal observed unusual wild bird mortalities at the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary, a UNESCO and Ramsar site. The outbreak affected 883 Great White pelicans (_Pelecanus onocrotalus_) of which 758 died, the majority being juvenile birds. On 4 Feb 2022, wild bird die-offs were reported in bordering Diawling National Park, another UNESCO and Ramsar site, this time in south west Mauritania. The outbreak was caused by an HPAI virus and also predominantly affected juvenile Great White pelicans, raising concerns about population conservation. National park staff are cleaning up the outbreak sites, removing carcasses and preventing predators from accessing the bird colony and spreading the virus by feeding on or carrying infected carcasses. The 2 parks are in the geographical area between Senegal and Mauritania.Samples collected by wildlife authorities in Senegal tested positive for H5N1 HPAI virus, however further characterization is awaited. It is very likely that the virus belongs to clade 2.3.4.4b, given its current circulation and predominance in Europe and West Africa, both in wild and domestic birds. These events follow a similar spatio-temporal pattern as observed at the end of January 2021, when H5N1 HPAI outbreaks were reported in pelicans in those same sites of Mauritania and Senegal. Recently published phylogenetic and spatial investigations indicated that H5N1 HPAI viruses involved in the 2021 events were closely related to H5 HPAI viruses clade 2.3.4.4b circulating in Europe at that time, particularly the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy, and that a highly likely source of introduction was through wild bird migrations coming from Europe along the East Atlantic flyway (Lo Fatou et al., 2022; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113333).Over the past months, H5N1 HPAI viruses have been frequently detected in European wild bird populations (e.g. United Kingdom, the Netherlands) and outbreaks were reported in shorebirds in Namibia and South Africa, and in common cranes (_Grus grus_) in Israel [see comment]. Several countries of the West Africa Region continue to report outbreaks of the disease in poultry, with regional spread facilitated by poultry trade. Furthermore, with HPAI well established in the West and Southern Africa regions, virus spillover from poultry to wild birds might also occur and result in further spread of the disease.Countries in Africa should therefore be on high alert for introduction and spread of H5N1 HPAI virus, either through wild bird movements and/or poultry trade. It is crucial to maintain and enhance efforts in monitoring wild bird die-offs and responding quickly to HPAI outbreaks to control the disease in wetlands of international importance, particularly in species under conservation efforts, and prevent further spread or spillover. It is important to highlight that spillover of AI viruses may happen either way: from wild birds to poultry or from poultry to wild birds.The management of HPAI outbreaks in wild birds can be challenging due to multiple factors such as site accessibility, soil cover, wild bird stress, and lack of human and financial resources, among others.In this context, FAO organized a webinar to share country experiences in the management of large-scale HPAI outbreaks in wild birds and lessons learned on 10 Feb 2022 and the recording is accessible via FAO's YouTube channel (in English):PART 1: https://youtu.be/damySnrQuYY PART 2: https://youtu.be/ClJzwsq4E28On 24 Jan 2022, the Scientific Task Force on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds issued a statement entitled ""H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in poultry and wild birds: Winter of 2021/2022"" with focus on mass mortality of wild birds in UK and Israel which provides exhaustive recommendations and guidance for those managing regionally and globally important sites for waterbirds and other wildlife; accessible at https://www.cms.int/sites/default/files/uploads/avian_influenza_0.pdf.FAO recommends intensified surveillance and awareness raising by national authorities, investigating any observed mortalities in wild birds or poultry for HPAI.There is no benefit to be gained in attempting to control the virus in wild birds through culling or habitat destruction. Spraying of birds or the environment with disinfectant -- for example sodium hypochlorite or bleach -- is considered potentially counter-productive, harmful to the environment and not effective from a disease control perspective.There is also no justification for any pre-emptive culling of endangered species in zoological collections. Control measures for captive wild birds in places where virus is detected should be based on isolating the affected and surrounding areas and applying strict movement control. -- Communicated by:Katinka de Balogh (CFIC) FAORome, Italy <katinka.debalogh@fao.org>[On top of the (about 8000) fatal cases in cranes, several dozen migrating Great White pelicans were found dead in Israel during December 2021; all (7) lab-tested individuals were found HPAI H5N1 positive (20211227.8700508, 20220116.8700909).The above FAO alert includes also the following chapters:1. Recommendations to national authorities, presenting, among other issues, the following 2 underlined sections with useful contact addresses: a. Ensure that the means for laboratory testing are in place to detect the currently circulating avian influenza viruses, especially those of clade 2.3.4.4 (contact: <EMPRES-Lab-Unit@fao.org>).b. Gene sequencing should be performed for all H5 viruses detected, either in national, regional or international reference laboratories. FAO can assist with the shipment of samples (contact: <EMPRES-Shipping-Service@fao.org>). Results should be shared with the global community in a timely manner to aid understanding of how the virus is spreading.2. Recommendations to hunters and hunter-gatherers.3. Recommendations to poultry producers. 4. General recommendations.5. Key guidance (10 links to relevant sources). According to a graphic with weekly data, obtained from 31 European countries since the start of the epizootic in October 2021, the major event has peaked in Europe during the 2nd week of 2022, after which a distinct weekly decrease is apparent.

He developed symptoms on 12 Jan 2022 and was admitted for treatment on 13 Jan 2022. The patient is in critical condition.The 2nd case involves a 35-year-old man living in Zhenjiang City in Jiangsu Province who had visited a live poultry market before onset. He developed symptoms on 15 Jan 2022 and was admitted for treatment on 19 Jan 2022. The patient is in critical condition.From 2014 to date [15 Feb 2022], 67 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g., chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death.People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.--Communicated by:ProMED[Based on the above report, these are the 4th and 5th human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in 2022, with 67 human cases reported in China since 2014. Both the reported cases are in critical condition.According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBAProMED map:China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701493,155] See Also

To determine whether red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) are susceptible to infection with HPAI virus (H5N1), we infected 3 foxes intratracheally. They excreted virus pharyngeally for 3-7 days at peak titers of 103.5-105.2 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL and had severe pneumonia, myocarditis, and encephalitis. To determine whether foxes can become infected by the presumed natural route, we fed infected bird carcasses to 3 other red foxes. These foxes excreted virus pharyngeally for 3-5 days at peak titers of 104.2-104.5 TCID50/mL, but only mild or no pneumonia developed. This study demonstrates that red foxes fed bird carcasses infected with HPAI virus (H5N1) can excrete virus while remaining free of severe disease, thereby potentially playing a role in virus dispersal.""[2] Abstract------------""We detected infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b in 2 red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) cubs found in the wild with neurologic signs in the Netherlands.

Following appropriate disease control measures, and in accordance with EU and national legislation, all restriction zones have now been removed.""""Avian influenza continues to be reported in wild birds across Ireland.

Authorities are testing commercial and backyard poultry flocks nearby in Kentucky and Tennessee.The disease was also detected in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Virginia, that have already been culled, the US Department of Agriculture said. The cases do not present an immediate public health concern, the agency said.Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the US East Coast.The United States is the world's largest producer and 2nd-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the US government. Kentucky said it is the 7th biggest chicken-meat-producing state. Almost 18% of US poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic. Government data showed US frozen chicken supplies were down 14% from a year ago at the end of December [2021] while turkey inventories were down 23%.[Byline: Tom Polansek]--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED map of Kentucky, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701469,220]******[2] Virginia (Fauquier County): mixed flockDate: Mon 14 Feb 2021Source USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) [edited]https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-ky-va-flocksThe United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in birds in 2 states: a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.Samples from 2 Kentucky flocks were tested at the Breathitt Veterinary Center Laboratory, and samples from the affected Virginia flock were tested at the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Harrisonburg Regional Animal Health Laboratory, both part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The Virginia and Fulton County, Kentucky, cases were confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. The Breathitt Veterinary Center Laboratory also obtained a non-negative avian influenza test result on the samples from a Webster County turkey flock, and NVSL confirmation is pending.APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in Kentucky and Virginia on joint incident responses. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Depopulation is complete in Virginia. Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these avian influenza detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] kills bacteria and viruses.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and in migratory wild bird populations.Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern.APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.Additional backgroundAvian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus, which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin, or ""H"" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or ""N"" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of ""H"" and ""N"" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED map of Virginia, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701469,247][Regrettably this virus is spreading, and spreading rapidly. If you can close your barns, or take your pets inside, it would be a helpful measure, hopefully preventing this virus from affecting your birds.Practice good biosecurity. Change clothes before entering a poultry barn, blow your nose and wash your hands and be sure you have on sanitized boots and a clean hair cap.If you have poultry at home and work on a commercial farm, then you need to be especially careful. Also let your employer know you have pet birds, whether poultry or pets or both.It takes extreme vigilance to protect the birds and yourself. - Mod.TG] See Also

Intercontinental spread of Eurasian highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) to Senegal. Emerg Infect Dis. 2022; 28(1): 234-237; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/1/21-1401_article--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------""In January 2021, Senegal reported the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N1), which was detected on a poultry farm in Thies, Senegal, and in great white pelicans in the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary. We report evidence of new transcontinental spread of H5N1 from Europe toward Africa.""Conclusions-----------""These evolutionary and spatial investigations indicate that the H5N1 outbreaks in Senegal did not emerge from local evolution of H5N1 viruses in Africa. These new viruses seem to have been introduced in fall 2020 from Eurasia through migratory birds flying southwest for winter. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (October-December 2020) and the long branches that separate the Senegal viruses from progenitors in Europe suggest an undetected virus circulating in the area, likely in wild birds.""The Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary, located in the Senegal River delta along the East Atlantic Flyway, is a sanctuary for large breeding waterbirds, including great white pelicans. H5N1 caused the death of hundreds of pelicans there. Before the emergence of the HPAI H5Nx viruses of the Gs/GD lineage, infection with avian influenza virus of pelicans was rarely reported. The incursion of the Gs/GD lineage has resulted in numerous fatal infections in this species. On the basis of data from the avian influenza passive surveillance system implemented in Europe during 2005-2017, an HPAI detection rate of 9.5% has been estimated in great white pelicans. This species is highly gregarious, behavior that could have promoted the spread of HPAI in these birds in Senegal. Unfortunately, surveillance of wild and domestic birds near where the H5N1-infected pelicans were identified did not shed light on the species responsible for introducing the virus. The wetlands of Senegal are inhabited by millions of aquatic bird species, including Garganey (_Anas querquedula_), Northern pintail (_A. acuta_), Northern shoveler (_Spatula clypeata_), Eurasian teal (_Anas crecca_), Eurasian wigeon (_Mareca penelope_), common pochard (_Aythya farina_), and tufted duck (_Aythya fuligula_), many of which have had a role in the spread of Gs/GD-lineage H5 viruses. This bird population has been hardly affected by the 2020-2021 epidemic in Europe, during which HPAI H5 virus infections were reported in apparently healthy birds. Therefore, even considering that most of the great white pelicans residing in the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary are deemed to be sedentary, species other than pelicans might have been involved in introducing and spreading H5N1 within Senegal or to neighboring countries reporting HPAI H5N1, including Niger, Nigeria, Mauritania, and Mali.""Recent reports of H5N1 in Senegal, Mauritania, and Mali indicate an unprecedented westward spread of the virus in Africa. However, the lack of genetic information on the viruses detected in these countries makes it difficult to reconstruct the exact number of virus introductions and dynamics of virus dissemination, and both poultry trade and wild bird movements remain valid candidate pathways. Moreover, after the outbreaks of HPAI in poultry, 2 states in Nigeria reported 7 suspected human cases of avian influenza H5N1, 4 in Kano, and 3 in Plateau. These cases confirm the importance of One Health joint activities by public human and animal health sectors to contain and monitor virus spread and the emergence of novel viruses of major concern.""There is still much to learn about the ecology of these viruses in the wild bird population; detection of the 2.3.4.4b clade in Senegal demonstrates that predicting the dissemination trajectories of these viruses is difficult.

After examinations, the Prefecture of Manche confirmed that the pigeon had died of avian influenza. This is the 2nd case in the same region within a week. The previous case involved a common shelduck found dead on the nearby beach of Saint-Jean-le Thomas on 1 Feb 2022.Following the detection of avian influenza in these 2 wild birds, the temporary control zone in Manche has been extended, implying restrictive measures and strict health instructions.In Normandy, this is the 5th case of avian influenza listed, after the 3 outbreaks identified in the communes in Seine-Maritime.This 4th episode of avian influenza in France mainly affects the South West of the country, where many farms have been affected since the end of November 2021.According to a census of the Ministry of Agriculture, France had, as of 1 Feb 2022, 328 outbreaks in farms, including 218 in Landes, in the heart of the foie gras country, where mass slaughters were organized. Nearly 3 million poultry, including 1.9 million waterfowl, have been slaughtered to eradicate avian influenza since the 1st cases were detected.The previous epizootic, last winter [2020-21], resulted in the slaughter of more than 3.5 million poultry, mainly ducks.[Byline: Pauline Latrouitte]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[The media report above does not specify the full identity of the virus detected in the 2 recent wild birds; assumed, it is HPAI H5N1; confirmation expected.According to the data of France's Ministry of Agriculture, the 1st outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was detected on 26 Nov 2021 in a commercial laying hen farm in the commune of Warhem, in the Nord department. This was the 1st case on farms since last winter's epizootic which lasted until spring 2021 (caused by H5N8). On 16 Dec 2021, an H5N1 type outbreak was confirmed in a farm of ducks ready to force-feed in the town of Manciet, in the Gers. This was the 1st poultry outbreak highlighted in the Southwest since the start of this new episode. Several other farms have since been affected and new cases have been detected in wildlife. As of 14 Feb 2022, France has had 354 outbreaks of HPAI in livestock, 33 cases in wildlife, and 15 cases in backyards (https://agriculture.gouv.fr/influenza-aviaire-la-situation-en-france).The continuing, major HPAI outbreak, involving mainly H5N1, has spread, since its start in Oct 2021, within 4 continents -- Asia, Europe, Africa, and, most recently, North America. The most affected continent is Europe.Numbers of AI events, involving poultry, captive birds, and wild birds, reported from 31 European countries since the start of the epizootic and as of 10 Feb 2022 (from the 40th week of 2021 -- week of 4 Oct 2021 -- to the 6th week of 2022 -- week of 7 Feb 2022), are available at https://www.izsvenezie.com/documents/reference-laboratories/avian-influenza/europe-updates/HPAI/2021-1/total-events.pdf. They include a total of 902 outbreaks on poultry farms, led by Italy (308), France (301), and Hungary (113). The total number of infected wild birds was 1606, of which 869 were in Germany, followed by the Netherlands (284) and Denmark (89). The same website of IZS Venezia presents a graphic with weekly data; the epizootic peaked during the 2nd week of 2022, after which a distinct weekly decrease is apparent in Europe.A cumulative global list of bird species reportedly infected by avian influenza virus (AVI) since 2005, is available at https://www.fao.org/ag/AGAInfo/programmes/en/empres/Global_AIV_Zoonotic_Update/table_species_H5N8_HPAI.html. The list includes 5 groups:1. Domestic bird species affected.2. Farmed wildlife species affected (Private collections, displays, or production).3. Wild birds involved in transmission.4. Wild birds known as accidental hosts.5. Scavenger wild birds and birds of prey.The bird species newly affected by H5Nx HPAI since February 2019 are listed in red.A map, presenting the global distribution of AIV with zoonotic potential observed since 1 Oct 2021 (that is, the current wave) as of 26 Jan 2022, is available at https://www.fao.org/ag/AGAInfo/programmes/en/empres/Global_AIV_Zoonotic_Update/situation_update.html.During the recent major epizootic, recorded human infections have been exceptional. - Mod.ASProMED map:Genêts, Normandy, France: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701457,68674] See Also

That same day, 25 new cases were detected in North Carolina.These detections follow earlier reports of confirmed HPAI cases in wild birds in North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, and Florida, as well as a confirmed case in a flock of 29 000 commercial turkeys in Indiana.All of the Delaware cases were found in Kent County and all of the New Hampshire cases were in Rockingham County. However, the cases in North Carolina were more widespread, with 16 in Pamlico County, 5 in Hyde County, and 4 in Bladen County.In all cases, the virus found was of the H5 lineage, with APHIS more specifically describing them as H5N1 cases.With the exception of the HPAI case found at the Indiana turkey farm, all US detections were found through an avian influenza surveillance program initiated by the APHIS Wildlife Services agency.APHIS recently announced with all the confirmed HPAI cases, it would expand its surveillance program. Previously, the agency was just monitoring birds in the Atlantic and Pacific flyways, but it has added surveillance of the Mississippi and Central flyways. APHIS anticipates it will collect a total of 31 000 wild bird samples in 49 states.In addition to the confirmed cases of HPAI in the United States, there have also been confirmed cases in Canada, including a commercial turkey flock in Nova Scotia. The virus has also been discovered in Newfoundland and Labrador.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[Highly pathogenic avian influenza has now reached further than the New England states, with a case in the Midwest (Indiana).

WA Seabird Rescue told the City of Vincent [a local government area of Western Australia, in metropolitan Perth] last month [January 2022] its volunteers had found 2 sick birds suspected of having botulism.Botulism is a rare but serious condition caused by toxins from bacteria. Outbreaks occur in higher temperatures, but vary in severity.Water testing is under way at the Perth park and the City of Vincent has hired 360 environmental [workers] to monitor the lakes amid rising temperatures.Mayor Emma Cole said as of Monday [7 Feb 2022], the City had received 2 monitoring reports indicating the water was ""good with slightly elevated nutrient levels at some sampling locations"". ""No pesticides or hydrocarbons were detected,"" Ms Cole said. She said dormant spores of the bacteria causing botulism in birds was naturally abundant in the lake sediment but towards the end of summer the spores germinated, leading to outbreaks. ""The City has informed the public of the possible presence of botulism in the lakes through social media posts. On-site signage is being prepared,"" she said. ""We are also working with WA Seabird Rescue to treat sick birds and remove dead carcasses, as quick removal of dead birds reduces the spread of botulism. We have installed lake aerators which reduces spore germination."" Ms Cole said there was minimal risk of catching the disease from the water, but humans and pets were advised to keep away.UWA professor Anas Ghadouani said with climate change leading to higher temperatures and low water levels in lakes, the ""stresses"" on urban lakes was greater. ""We need Federal and State government help to work together because the problems are getting more complex,"" Dr Ghadouani said. ""The question arises, 'why do we care about urban lakes?'. With the changing climate, blue and green corridors combined together are what build resilience and allow communities to sustain heatwaves and climate change.""Residents who see birds that look unwell are asked to call Seabird Rescue on 6102 8464.[byline: Jake Dietsch]--communicated by:ProMED[""Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. This pathogen is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.""Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (e.g. chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.""Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the third eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.""Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) are highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment.""Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Also, providing it to wild bird populations is extremely challenging and often unfeasible. Birds surviving a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin.""Portions of this comment were extracted from: https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/avian-botulism.Please also note, the water is not safe for your pets, and please do not let your pets play with, mouth or consume one of the deceased birds. Furthermore, the maggots on any decaying carcasses may also contain botulism, so please handle carcasses with care. Consumption of the deceased birds or the maggots could sicken your pets. - Mod.TGProMED map:Perth, Western Australia, Australia: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701392,456] See Also

Cases of the disease, known as bird flu, can hurt the US farm sector because poultry are killed and trading partners can limit imports from infected areas. China said on Monday [7 Feb 2022] it banned imports of poultry from Spain and Moldova due to outbreaks.Bird flu does not present an immediate public health concern, the USDA said. But the infected turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, in the south of the state, suffered increased mortality, according to the agency.Indiana said the strain of the virus was H5N1 and this was the state's first case of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry since 2016. The H5N1 strain has also been found in wild birds along the US east coast this year [2022].[byline: Tom Polansek]--communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>******[2]Date: Wed 9 Feb 2022Source: APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) [edited]https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-indianaThe United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana. This is the first confirmed case of HPAI in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020.Avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] kills bacteria and viruses.Samples from the affected flock, which experienced increased mortality, were tested at the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Purdue University, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. Virus isolation is ongoing.APHIS is working closely with the Indiana Board of Animal Health (BOAH) on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property were depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in the nearby area. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to [ensure] the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.USDA will report this finding to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern.In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through USDA's toll-free number. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.Additional background---------------------Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or ""H"" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or ""N"" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of ""H"" and ""N"" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains which circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high) -- the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.--communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi[Vigilance is very important at this time. Keep a close eye on your birds. Report the slightest hint of illness to your veterinarian. Early identification of signs of illness can help stop the spread of this very contagious virus, and lessen losses on a larger scale.""Avian influenza refers to infection of birds with avian influenza type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Wild aquatic birds can be infected with avian influenza A viruses in their intestines and respiratory tract, but usually do not get sick. However, avian influenza A viruses are very contagious among birds, and some of these viruses can sicken and even kill certain domesticated bird species including chickens, ducks, and turkeys.""Infected birds can shed avian influenza A viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Susceptible birds become infected when they have contact with the virus as it is shed by infected birds. They also can become infected through contact with surfaces that are contaminated with virus from infected birds"" (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-in-birds.htm).Biosecurity is not just a happy thought. It is an active practice of not tracking a disease around. If there is an ill bird and you handled it or its food/water containers, then you should not handle other birds and should carefully wash your hands, change coveralls and boots and even blow your nose before being near other birds. Report any illness immediately to the supervisor and/or your veterinarian. - Mod.TGProMED map of Indiana, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701372,217.] See Also

This follows similar reports of the H5N1 Eurasian strain from South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Canada (Newfoundland and Labrador) this past fall and winter (2021-2022).This strain has been documented in Europe since early 2021. No known human infections with Eurasian H5 viruses have occurred in the United States.The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS] says these findings are not unexpected, as wild birds can be infected with HPAI and show no signs of illness. They can carry the disease to new areas when migrating. APHIS anticipates additional wild bird findings as robust wild bird sampling program continues into the spring.FWC is monitoring for HPAI in birds found sick or dead of unknown causes and highlights ways to help prevent HPAI spread:- Report bird mortalities so die-offs can be investigated and tested.- Prevent contact of domestic or captive birds with wild birds (especially waterfowl).- Do not handle sick/dead wildlife. If it is necessary to do so then wear impermeable gloves, wash hands with soap and water, and change clothing before having any contact with healthy domestic poultry and birds.- Hunters and others handling birds should follow routine precautions listed below when handling wild birds.--communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[This new report from Florida attests to the spread of Eurasian HPAI H5 viruses are spreading in North America, previously reported in Nova Scotia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia.From 2014 onwards, HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses caused outbreaks across the Eurasian region, affecting both poultry and wild birds, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8. So far, the subtype reported in the Americas is H5N1.Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses.

[Probably it is avian influenza H5N1. - Mod.TG]Prior to today [4 Feb 2022], cases were discovered in a wild goose and a backyard flock of chickens not meant for commercial production.Speaking on CBC's Maritime Noon, Dr. Margaret McGeoghegan, a veterinarian with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Atlantic division, said she wasn't at liberty to disclose a specific location for the barn.She said there are other commercial producers in the area, and restrictions are in place for commercial operations within 10 km [6.2 mi] of the affected barn to prevent the virus from spreading.""Because of the intensity of the production system, the risk there is very high, and also considering the fact there are lots of waterways and lots of exposure to wild birds,"" said McGeoghegan.She said people in the industry are extremely concerned about the cases.McGeoghegan said farms have strict biosecurity measures to try to prevent the virus from entering a farm. The virus, which is spread through airborne transmission, can be brought in inadvertently on shoes, equipment, and clothing, she said.""Because this strain is as highly pathogenic as it is, when it hits, sometimes there are no clinical signs other than the birds are dead,"" said McGeoghegan.On Friday [4 Feb 2022], the Nova Scotia Poultry Emergency Response Planning Committee -- which includes Chicken Farmers of Nova Scotia, Egg Farmers of Nova Scotia, and Hatching Egg Farmers of Nova Scotia -- released a statement saying the poultry industry is on high alert and asking for help from neighbors to help prevent the spread of avian flu.It said the industry has been following ""advanced biosecurity protocols"" to prevent spread since the 1st suspected case was found in a wild goose east of Halifax. The industry is cooperating with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's instructions.It is also putting out a call to anyone raising domestic fowl on their property to watch for signs of avian flu and take all precautions to keep their birds away from wild birds. It said if anyone sees a sick or dead wild bird, to report it online through the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative.--Communicated by:ProMED[Avian influenza spreads very easily between birds, from wild to domestic, or domestic to domestic birds. This is certainly a time to be practicing biosecurity: washing boots between barns, changing coveralls, even showering between barns, if possible. Vehicles need to be sprayed with an antimicrobial agent on tires, in the wheel wells, etc. to prevent tracking the virus into the facility. Although it is an airborne virus, one cannot be too careful. While some of these suggestions seem either obvious or over the top, the point is that biosecurity encompasses all aspects of the poultry facility. While the virus may be airborne, our movements are capable of carrying it into a facility, and awareness of this is the 1st step in prevention. Do not be around any backyard poultry while off-duty from your poultry employment. The risk of transmitting this virus is too great. Also, your health is important.Please note, avian influenza can also be a human health issue.""How can avian influenza (H5N1) infections be prevented?""If you travel to an area where avian influenza (H5N1) is a concern, you should take the proper precautions. See your health-care provider or visit a travel health clinic 6 weeks before you leave.""If you travel to an affected area, follow the precautions below:Avoid high-risk areas (poultry farms and live animal markets).Avoid contact with birds, including- chickens- ducks- wild birdsAvoid surfaces that may have bird droppings or secretions on them.Make sure that all poultry dishes, including eggs, are cooked well.Wash your hands frequently:- use soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds- if soap is not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (carry travel-sized dispensers)Monitor your health:- see a health-care provider if you develop flu-like symptoms while travelling or upon returning to Canada- explain that you have been travelling or living in an area where avian influenza (H5N1) is a concern.""(https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/avian-influenza-h5n1/prevention-avian-influenza-h5n1.html) - Mod.TGProMED map of Nova Scotia Province, Canada: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701308,271] See Also

The CFIA National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease has confirmed that the virus was H5N1, similar to the viruses reported in non-poultry and wild birds recently in the provinces of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. The virus has HA cleavage site motif ""PLREKRRK/GLF"" consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza strains of H5 subtype. The HA gene segment is A/goose/Guangdong/1996 (Gs/GD) lineage belonging to 2.3.4.4B clade. Phylogenic analysis indicates this virus corresponds to the Eurasian lineage circulating in 2021 in Europe. The CFIA has immediately quarantined the infected farm and is implementing strict movement controls and a stamping out policy. A protection zone (3 km [1.86 mi]) and a surveillance zone (10 km [6.21 mi]) are being put in place around the infected premises. Wildlife surveillance as well as the Canadian Avian Influenza Surveillance System (CanNAISS) activities for poultry are ongoing in Canada.Control measures at event levelDomestic control measures applied: Traceability; quarantine; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zoneDomestic control measures to be applied: Disinfection; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; zoningWild control measures applied: Surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zoneDiagnostic test resultsLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Outbreaks / Test date / ResultNational Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD), Winnipeg, Manitoba (national laboratory) / Birds / Gene sequencing / 1 / 3 Feb 2022 / PositiveNational Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD), Winnipeg, Manitoba (national laboratory) / Birds / Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 1 / 3 Feb 2022 / Positive[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]--Communicated by:ProMED[On 4 Feb 2022, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) mentioned that ""This situation serves as a strong reminder that avian influenza is spreading across the globe in wild birds as they migrate to and from Canada, and that anyone with poultry or other susceptible birds should practice good biosecurity habits to protect them from animal diseases"" (https://bit.ly/3uvMtGj).

There are at least 15 types of avian influenza. Some wild bird species, such as ducks, can carry the virus and infect other birds without getting sick themselves. Other bird species are more likely to become severely ill and die when infected with some types of avian influenza.As a general guideline, the public should not handle live, sick, or dead wild birds. People should contact the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables at 1-800-565-2224 to report sick or dead birds.The Province is working with the federal government and other agencies to monitor and respond to the situation.""Avian influenza poses little risk to people, but the virus is highly infectious and potentially deadly in wild and domestic birds. We urge the public to avoid feeding or handling wild birds like ducks, geese, pheasants, pigeons, and gulls to prevent disease spread,"" said Bob Petrie, Director of Wildlife, Natural Resources and Renewables.Quick facts------------ Birds that meet testing criteria will be collected and sent to the lab at the Atlantic Veterinary College in Charlottetown.- Avian flu has been detected recently in other parts of Canada and the eastern United States.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[This news report from Canada confirms that Eurasian HPAI H5 viruses are spreading in North America. From 2014 onwards HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses caused outbreaks across the Eurasian region, affecting both poultry and wild birds, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8.So far, the subtype reported in the Americas is H5N1. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swans, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. Numerous species of birds that migrate along Nearctic and Palearctic flyways breed in Arctic tundra regions, providing opportunities for HPAI viruses to be introduced into another continent. Thus, the migration of those species could have been the cause of the introduction of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 into the Americas. - Mod.PMBProMED map:Grand Desert, Nova Scotia, Canada: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701217,68667] See Also

The Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources said, ""These detections were not unexpected.""According to the CDC, the virus can make the birds sick or result in death, but most birds infected do not end up getting sick. The risk to the public is low, and people should be mindful that they properly prepare and handle meat and eggs.Avian influenza can negatively impact poultry, which can harm backyard farmers and commercial productions. The department of wildlife said people who are farming poultry should review their biosecurity efforts to keep their birds separate from possibly infected wild birds.If your birds become ill, you can report it to the State Veterinarian's Office at (804) 692-0601 or at <vastatevet@vdacs.virginia.gov>.[Byline: Emma North]--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[New reports show that Eurasian HPAI H5 viruses are spreading in North America. From 2014 onwards HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses caused outbreaks across the Eurasian region, affecting both poultry and wild birds, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. Numerous species of birds that migrate along Nearctic and Palearctic flyways breed in Arctic tundra regions, providing opportunities for HPAI viruses to be introduced into another continent. Thus, migration of those species could have been the cause of the introduction of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 into the Americas. - Mod.PMBProMED map of Virginia, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701178,247] See Also

The patient had onset of disease on [13 Nov 2021].To date [24 Jan 2022], 24 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported to WHO from China in 2021.In most human cases of H9N2 avian flu, the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.--Communicated by:ProMED[Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk of sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing. - Mod.UBA]******[2] Avian influenza H5N6[A]Date: Thu 27 Jan 2022Source: The Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [edited]https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202201/27/P2022012700624.htmCHP closely monitors two human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Mainland---------------------------------------------------------------------------The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [27 Jan 2022] closely monitoring 2 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) on the Mainland, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.The 1st case involves a 68-year-old man living in Langzhong in Sichuan. He developed symptoms on [3 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [4 Jan 2022]. The patient is in critical condition.The 2nd case involves a 55-year-old woman living in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, who had exposure to slaughtered poultry before onset. She developed symptoms on [6 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [9 Jan 2022]. The patient is in critical condition.From 2014 to date [27 Jan 2022], 65 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms;- Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately; - Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>---[B]Date: Thu 27 Jan 2022Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]http://outbreaknewstoday.com/china-reports-two-additional-h5n6-avian-influenza-cases-in-2022/China reports 2 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6)------------------------------------------------------The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health reports closely monitoring two human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) in the Mainland.The 1st case involves a 68-year-old man living in Langzhong in Sichuan. He developed symptoms on [3 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [4 Jan 2022].

She developed symptoms on [6 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [9 Jan 2022]. The patient is in critical condition.This is the 2nd and 3rd cases reported in 2022 and since 2014, 65 human cases have been reported in China.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death.--Communicated by:ProMED[According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. There has been an increase in the number of human H5N6 cases in 2021; at least 5 cases were confirmed in December 2021, and 3 more in January 2022 based on the information in the reports above.The identified exposures in nearly all cases are related to handling live poultry, and there appears to be an increase in transmission events. Is there more H5N6 avian influenza virus circulating in poultry and/or more importantly, is the virus now more easily transmissible? High level of vigilance and active surveillance in both animal and human health is required. - Mod.UBAProMED map:China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701114,155] See Also

One outbreak affected a commercial turkey premises in Cheshire, England while the other 2 outbreaks occurred in backyard premises, one in Herefordshire, England (covered in the above media report) and one in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The circulation of the virus in wild birds was continuing (see commentary of item 2). There have been no further HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Northern Ireland since 17 Jan 2022. - Mod.AS]******[2] HPAI H5: outbreak assessment, DEFRA, conclusionsDate: Mon 24 Jan 2022Source: DEFRA Outbreak Assessment #11, Ref: VITT/1200 HPAI in the UK and Europe [conclusion chapter, abridged, edited]https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1050668/hpai-europe-220124.pdfConclusion----------Cases of HPAI H5 in wild birds and outbreaks in poultry continue to be reported across Europe and also in GB since our last assessment [17 Jan 2022]. Total numbers of migrating wild water birds (ducks, geese, and some swan species) will now have peaked in GB and the majority of wintering water birds have now arrived.There have been 537 confirmed cases of HPAI H5 in wild birds in GB to 24 Jan 2022 across a range of species, including a significant number of resident sedentary birds of species such as mute swan, Canada goose and some raptors indicating that they had been exposed to infection in GB itself. Furthermore, potential bridging species such as gulls, pheasants and some raptors have tested positive. In continental Europe, corvids and sparrows which could also serve as bridging species continue to be reported as infected. A recent European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) presentation reported that between 15 Sep and 1 Dec 2021, 219 poultry HPAI outbreaks were reported across Europe (and the UK). Of these, 35% had been observed in fattening turkeys, compared to 9% during the same time period in 2020, with a large increase also observed in broilers, representing 15% of outbreaks in 2021 compared to 6% in 2020. The majority (198) of poultry HPAI outbreaks in this period were reported from commercial farms, 78 of which did not have outdoor access and raises concern regarding the stringency of applied biosecurity measures.Further virus detections are expected across northeast and southeast Europe over the coming months, following incursions from migratory waterbirds, with the epizootic potentially extending the southern and western limits observed in previous seasons.The increased rate of HPAI detection in the greylag and barnacle goose initially observed in the 2020/21 season has continued into the 2021/22 season. In light of this, EFSA is currently in the process of revising the list of target species for passive surveillance in wild birds.More wild bird HPAI H5 infections are expected in sedentary species and potential bridging species in GB. HPAI H5 will continue to circulate in both susceptible migrant water birds and sedentary bird species within GB over the next few months, with a greater number of events likely to be observed around water bird wintering sites. The risk level of HPAI H5 in wild birds is therefore maintained at VERY HIGH across GB. The risk of exposure of poultry across the whole GB is maintained at MEDIUM (with low uncertainty) where good biosecurity is applied, and at HIGH (with low uncertainty) where biosecurity is suboptimal. This assessment takes into consideration the Avian Influenza Protection Zone (AIPZ) and assumes that bird keepers are taking the additional biosecurity measures required.Authors: Dr Lorna Freath, Joe Bowen, Dr Paul Gale & Dr Lauren Perrin--Communicated by:ProMED[According to DEFRA's updated assessment, in continental Europe, since 17 Jan 2022, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Slovakia reported further outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 and Spain reported its 1st outbreak of H5N1 in domestic poultry of the current HPAI season. Wild bird HPAI H5 cases continued to be reported, since the previous assessment, in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia and Slovenia. The highest number of cases was reported in Denmark (38) which included a single case of HPAI H5N8. Cases of HPAI H5N1 in wild birds have been reported in Latvia for the 1st time this HPAI season.The DEFRA Outbreak Assessment includes also the following:1.

The 2nd case is a 3 year old girl from Huanggang City, Hubei Province who became ill on 7 Dec 2021. The 3rd case is a 14 year old schoolgirl from Nanning City, Guangxi Province who became ill on 9 Dec 2021. The case was hospitalized with a mild condition on 9 Dec 2021. The 4th case is a 3 year old boy from Huanggang City, Hubei Province who became ill on 13 Dec 2021.All of the 4 cases were mild and had already recovered from the disease at the time of reporting to WHO. Before illness onset, the cases had been exposed to poultry. No family members have developed symptoms at the time of reporting. Following investigations, no epidemiological links have been determined among the 4 cases.To date, 24 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported to WHO from China in 2021, and a total of 65 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) including 2 deaths (both with underlying conditions) have been reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region since December 2015. The last case was reported from China with onset date of 13 Dec 2021.--communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[Avian H9N2 influenza A viruses have caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. Among the earlier cases, an H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5 year old child in Hong Kong in 2003.Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. The dates of onset for the 4 cases in the report above are in November and December 2021, technically adding these cases to last year's (2021) case count , bringing the total for A/H9N2 cases reported from China to 24. The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission as evidenced by the history of poultry exposure in the cases reported here. - Mod.UBAProMED map:China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700993,155] See Also

That strain has caused a wave of outbreaks of bird flu in poultry across Europe and Asia. H5N1 is one of the few bird flu strains that has passed to humans, though US officials said there was a low risk to people from the case confirmed on Friday [14 Jan 2022].The infections are disappointing because it is rare for a Eurasian strain to make its way to North America, said Carol Cardona, a professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota. ""Avian influenza viruses tend to stay in their hemisphere,"" she said. The latest US cases were in Colleton County in South Carolina, where Friday's infection was found in a wild duck, and in Hyde County in North Carolina, the USDA said.Wild birds can transmit avian flu to each other or to poultry through direct contact and through their feathers or feces. ""These findings are not unexpected, as wild birds can be infected with HPAI and show no signs of illness,"" the USDA said. ""They can carry the disease to new areas when migrating."" The USDA advised poultry producers to review safety measures to assure the health of their flocks and said people should wear gloves when dealing with wild birds.Cardona said poultry producers need to make sure the virus cannot enter their barns. ""Poultry producers are going to be busy this spring,"" she said. ""They have to check the doors and windows every day, twice a day, 10 times a day.""The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Tuesday [18 Jan 2022] that Spain reported an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu on a farm north of Madrid.[byline: Tom Polansek]--communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[From 2014 onwards HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses caused outbreaks across the Eurasian region, affecting both poultry and wild birds, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds have contributed to the propagation of HPAI viruses. Numerous species of birds that migrate along Nearctic and Palearctic flyways breed in tundra regions of the Arctic, providing opportunities for HPAI viruses to be introduced to another continent. Thus, migration of those species could have been the cause of the introduction of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 into the Americas. - Mod.PMBProMED maps:Colleton County, South Carolina, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700990,13112Hyde County, North Carolina, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700990,14214] See Also

The H7N9 avian influenza virus appeared in China in 2013 as a low-pathogenicity virus, initially being asymptomatic in birds or accompanied by mild disease. In contrast, the virus was zoonotic and presented a respiratory manifestation in humans with a considerable infectivity from bird to human. The subclinical presentation in poultry made it very difficult, for the health authorities, to control the spread of the virus in the human population in China.The combined infection, carried out by British researchers, produced 2 H9N2 and H9N9 viruses. The H9N9 virus presented high replication in human cells and in ferrets, the human-compatible model for influenza virus research.The study warns of the possibility of ""new"" influenza viruses following the endemic status of H9N2 and H7N9 viruses in China: viruses that will be more pathogenic to birds and have a high zoonotic potential.--communicated byProMED[The reference for the 'accepted manuscript' above, authored by researchers from The Pirbright Institute, Woking, Surrey, and the Animal & Plant Health Agency, Weybridge, UK, published online 12 Jan 2022, is:Bhat S, James J, Sadeyen JR, et al. Co-infection of chickens with H9N2 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses leads to emergence of reassortant H9N9 virus with increased fitness for poultry and a zoonotic potential. J Virol 2022; https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01856-21.The paper's ""Importance"" section follows:""We evaluated the consequences of reassortment between the H7N9 and the contemporary H9N2 viruses of G1 lineage that are enzootic in poultry across the Indian sub-continent and the Middle East. Co-infection of chickens with these viruses resulted in emergence of novel reassortant H9N9 viruses with genes derived from both H9N2 and H7N9 viruses. The '6+2' reassortant H9N9 (having NP and NA from H7N9) virus was shed from contact chickens in a significantly higher proportion compared to most of the reassortant viruses, showed significantly increased replication fitness in human A549 cells, receptor binding towards human (α2,6) and avian (α2,3) sialic acid receptor analogues and the potential to transmit via contact among ferrets. This study demonstrated the ability of viruses that already exist in nature to exchange genetic material, highlighting the potential emergence of viruses from these subtypes with zoonotic potential.""While the world's attention has been paid during the 2 recent years to the COVID-19 pandemic, the experimental results above as well as other viruses with zoonotic potential already afield should be kept in mind. The current panzootic of HPAI H5N1, a virus that managed to spread within 2-3 months by/to wild and domestic birds in 4 continents, including (sporadic) infections in mammals, is an actual reminder. - Mod.AS] See Also

In contrast, the virus was zoonotic and presented a respiratory manifestation in humans with a considerable infectivity from bird to human. The subclinical presentation in poultry made it very difficult, for the health authorities, to control the spread of the virus in the human population in China.The combined infection, carried out by British researchers, produced 2 H9N2 and H9N9 viruses. The H9N9 virus presented high replication in human cells and in ferrets, the human-compatible model for influenza virus research.The study warns of the possibility of ""new"" influenza viruses following the endemic status of H9N2 and H7N9 viruses in China: viruses that will be more pathogenic to birds and have a high zoonotic potential.--communicated byProMED[The reference for the 'accepted manuscript' above, authored by researchers from The Pirbright Institute, Woking, Surrey, and the Animal & Plant Health Agency, Weybridge, UK, published online 12 Jan 2022, is:Bhat S, James J, Sadeyen JR, et al. Co-infection of chickens with H9N2 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses leads to emergence of reassortant H9N9 virus with increased fitness for poultry and a zoonotic potential. J Virol 2022; https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01856-21.The paper's ""Importance"" section follows:""We evaluated the consequences of reassortment between the H7N9 and the contemporary H9N2 viruses of G1 lineage that are enzootic in poultry across the Indian sub-continent and the Middle East. Co-infection of chickens with these viruses resulted in emergence of novel reassortant H9N9 viruses with genes derived from both H9N2 and H7N9 viruses. The '6+2' reassortant H9N9 (having NP and NA from H7N9) virus was shed from contact chickens in a significantly higher proportion compared to most of the reassortant viruses, showed significantly increased replication fitness in human A549 cells, receptor binding towards human (α2,6) and avian (α2,3) sialic acid receptor analogues and the potential to transmit via contact among ferrets. This study demonstrated the ability of viruses that already exist in nature to exchange genetic material, highlighting the potential emergence of viruses from these subtypes with zoonotic potential.""While the world's attention has been paid during the 2 recent years to the COVID-19 pandemic, the experimental results above as well as other viruses with zoonotic potential already afield should be kept in mind. The current panzootic of HPAI H5N1, a virus that managed to spread within 2-3 months by/to wild and domestic birds in 4 continents, including (sporadic) infections in mammals, is an actual reminder. - Mod.AS] See Also

Corr.SB, edited]https://news-24.fr/la-grippe-aviaire-craint-alors-que-la-chine-signale-deux-deces-apres-cinq-nouveaux-cas-de-h5n6-alors-que-loms-appelle-a-une-action-urgente/China has reported 2 avian influenza deaths among 5 new confirmed cases of H5N6. The World Health Organzation has called for ""urgent"" action. A rise in the number of people infected with avian influenza in China last year [2021] has raised concern among experts, who have warned that the strain could be more infectious to humans. Two people in China have now died of bird flu; the other 3 remain in hospital.Hong Kong's health department said 5 people in Sichuan province, Zhejiang province and Guangxi autonomous region were infected with the bird flu strain in December last year [2021].One of the two who died was a 75 year old man from Luzhou in Sichuan Province. He fell ill on [1 Dec 2021] after being exposed to live domestic poultry. He was rushed to hospital 4 days later and died on [12 Dec 2021]. The other was a 54 year old man from Leshan in the same province. He became ill on [8 Dec 2021] and died 3 weeks later on [24 Dec 2021]. He too was reportedly exposed to live domestic fowl.A 51 year old woman from Hangzhou in Zhejiang province fell ill on [15 Dec 2021] after being exposed to live domestic poultry. She was taken to hospital on [18 Dec 2021] and authorities said she was in a critical condition. The other 2 cases were recorded in Liuzhou, a city in Guangxi Autonomous Region, the Hong Kong health department said. A 53 year old man with a history of exposure to dead poultry fell ill on [19 Dec 2021] and remains hospitalized in a serious condition. A 28 year old man from the same city became ill on [23 Dec 2021] and is believed to be in a critical condition. It was not immediately clear how he had become infected. Since 2014, 65 people have been infected with the H5N6 bird flu - over half of them in the past 6 months.WHO says most of the cases had been in contact with poultry and no cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed. But WHO says further investigation is ""urgent"" to understand the risk and understand the growing number of human cases.Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, previously warned: ""The increase in human cases in China this year [2021] is concerning. It is a virus that causes high mortality. ""It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (for people)... or there could be more of this virus in poultry right now and that is why more people are infected.""Warning to travellers---------------------China is the world's largest producer of poultry and the top producer of ducks, which act as a reservoir for flu viruses. Backyard farms in China are still common and many people still prefer to buy live chickens from markets. Although avian influenza viruses constantly circulate among domestic and wild birds, they rarely infect humans. But the evolution of the viruses, which have increased as poultry populations increase, is a major concern because they could turn into a virus that spreads easily between people and cause a pandemic. In November last year [2021], British health authorities issued a travel warning to China about the risk of bird flu. Dr Gavin Dabrera, consultant in acute respiratory infections at UKHSA, said: ""Anyone visiting China should avoid exposure to birds or live birds in 'wet markets' as a precautionary measure. ""We continue to encourage people to avoid touching dead or dying birds and to maintain good hand hygiene when traveling. Bird flu remains a risk in China and if travelers experience flu-like symptoms within 10 days of returning from China they should call their GP or NHS 111 and report their recent travel.""[byline: Delmary Delmar]--communicated by:ProMED[Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk of sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing.According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. There has been an increase in the number of human H5N6 cases in 2021 and at least 5 cases were confirmed in December 2021. The identified exposures in nearly all cases are related to handling live poultry, and there appears to be an increase in transmission events... Is there more H5N6 avian influenza virus circulating in poultry and/or more importantly, is the virus now more easily transmissible?

Mod.AS, abridged, edited]https://www.haaretz.co.il/nature/1.10538475The Ministry of Agriculture announced today [14 Jan 2022] that control has been gained over the outbreak of the bird flu that has hit hard the crane population in the Agamon Hahula area and led to the culling of poultry in farms of northern Israel. This week (16-21 Jan 2022) professionals are expected to concentrate their efforts on cleaning, disinfecting and monitoring the flu.Most of the crane carcasses have already been disposed of. In the coming weeks, monitoring operations will be conducted at the site to make sure there are none left. If conditions allow, the site will be reopened to visitors within a few weeks.The 1st case of the disease in the current outbreak was discovered in a pelican in the north of the country that was apparently infected from contact with migratory birds. The disease then spread to cranes and from there to chicken coops in other areas. About one million chickens had to be killed.During an online meeting of experts held this week at the initiative of the Steinhardt Museum of Nature at Tel Aviv University [see further in the commentary], the director of the Veterinary Services, Dr. Tamir Goshen, indicated that there is a problem with the biosafety level of layer coops in Israel and that they are far from meeting the requirements accepted in developed countries. One of the examples Goshen provided was the ease with which visitors can enter coops in the country, creating risk of infection. Another problem presented was the deficient monitoring activity in wild birds, including systematic collection of wild birds to be tested. The Director of the Science Division at the Nature and Parks Authority, Dr. Yehoshua Shakedi said that the authority has a plan to deal with the issue, but it has not yet been funded. The Ministry of Agriculture has announced that it will formulate a recovery plan and preparations for the next migratory season of wild birds.The ministry noted that avian flu is introduced every year into Israel but its spread during the current season was exceptional and that the virus strain found this year [2022] -- H5N1 -- is regarded hazardous to humans. An expert committee has been assigned by Israel's National Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) to formulate recommendations concerning the preparations for possible future bird flu outbreaks, to include also re-examination of the management of the Agamon Hahula site. This site has become one of Israel's leading attractions as far as number of visitors is concerned. Every year, flocks counting tens of thousands birds arrive at this site. Nature conservation bodies will be required to examine the cranes' feeding policy as applied on the site in order to prevent them from flying to nearby agricultural fields, damaging crops. This policy has led to an increase in the number of migrating birds who remain in the country and do not migrate further to Africa.[Byline: Zafrir Rinat]--Communicated by: ProMED[The mentioned online (zoom) webinar was held by the Tel Aviv University's Museum of Natural History on 11 Jan 2022. It was titled, ""How can we prepare for the next wave?"" An introductory presentation, based on information from the National Veterinary Services (poultry health division) and, for wild birds, from the Nature and Parks Authority, included the following Outstanding Loss: 1. Poultry: More than 1.1 million birds culled in more than 20 poultry farms.2. Wild birds: a. Common cranes (_Grus grus_, over-wintering) - about 8000 dead birds at the Agamon Hula; all 28 tested birds were H5N1 positive.b. Great white pelican (_Pelecanus onocrotalus_, over-wintering) - tens of dead birds observed, all 7 tested birds were H5N1 positive.c. Eurasian kestrel (_Falco tinnunculus_, mostly resident) - some dead birds observed, all 4 tested birds were H5N1 positive.d. Common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_, over-wintering) - some dead birds observed, 3 or 4 tested birds were H5N1 positive.e. Marbled teal (_Marmaronetta angustirostris_, resident) - one dead bird collected, tested positive for H5N1. Ran Nathan, of the Movement Ecology Lab, Hebrew University, presented the continuous follow-up of tagged cranes from Russia from 1 Dec 2021 to 10 Jan 2022. In 4 of the 10 tagged cranes, measurements indicative of affected health were recorded, eventually terminating in death. The points in time, for each of the 4 adult animals (3-4 years old; 3 males and one female) were presented: a. Beginning of disease according to ODBA (Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration, reflecting energetic expenditure); b. Beginning of disease according to movements; c. bird death. In addition, the date of the beginning of diversionary feeding (obviously, similar for all 4 birds) was included. ODBA seems to be the earliest predictor of disease; the earliest case started 13 December 2021. Notably, the 1st outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 on poultry farms were recorded in mid-November 2021 (in central and southern Israel), thus a month before the start of the crane epizootic in the north. The webinar included also presentations of invited guest speakers: David Swayne, USDA, ARS, USA; Susan Shriner, USDA, National Wildlife Research Center, USA and Thijs Kuiken, Dep Virology, Erasmus Medical Centre, The Netherlands.In case a recording of the webinar's presentations becomes available online, ProMED will publish the link.

Avian influenza overview September - December 2021; https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/AI-Report-XVIII_draft_published.pdf--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract --------""Between 16 Sep 2021 and 8 Dec 2021, 867 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections were reported in 27 EU/EEA countries and the UK in poultry (316), in wild (523) and in captive birds (28). The detections in poultry were mainly reported by Italy (167) followed by Hungary and Poland (35 each). The majority of the detections in wild birds were reported by Germany (280), Netherlands (65) and United Kingdom (53). The observed persistence and continuous circulation of HPAI viruses in migratory and resident wild birds will continue to pose a risk for the poultry industry in Europe for the coming months. The frequent occurrence of HPAI A(H5) incursions in commercial farms (including poultry production types considered at low avian influenza risk) raises concern about the capacity of the applied biosecurity measures to prevent virus introduction. Short-term preparedness and medium- and long-term prevention strategies, including revising and reinforcing biosecurity measures, reduction of the density of commercial poultry farms and possible appropriate vaccination strategies, should be implemented. The results of the genetic analysis indicate that the viruses characterised during this reporting period belong to clade 2.3.4.4b. Some of the characterized HPAI A(H5N1) viruses detected in Sweden, Germany, Poland and United Kingdom are related to the viruses which have been circulating in Europe since October 2020; in North, Central, South and East Europe novel reassortant A(H5N1) virus has been introduced starting from October 2021. HPAI A(H5N1) was also detected in wild mammal species in Sweden, Estonia and Finland; some of these strains characterised so far present an adaptive marker that is associated with increased virulence and replication in mammals. Since the last report, 13 human infections due to HPAI A(H5N6) and 2 human cases due to LPAI A(H9N2) virus have been reported from China. Some of these A(H5N6) cases were caused by a reassortant virus of clade 2.3.4.4b, which possessed an HA gene closely related to the A(H5) viruses circulating in Europe. The risk of infection for the general population in the EU/EEA is assessed as low, and for occupationally exposed people, low to medium, with large uncertainty due to the high diversity of circulating viruses in the bird populations.""An outbreak map of HPAI in Europe from 8 Oct 2021 to 14 Jan 2022 is available at https://izsvenezie.com/documents/reference-laboratories/avian-influenza/europe-updates/HPAI/2021-1/maps.pdf.

Federal officials confirmed Sunday [9 Jan 2022] H5N1 bird flu killed chickens in a small backyard flock.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] says avian flu has killed chickens at a small, backyard farm on the Avalon Peninsula. ""This backyard flock owner had just a few chickens and ducks,"" Dr. Mary-Jane Ireland, the agency's chief veterinary officer, told CBC News on Tuesday [11 Jan 2022]. Last week, CBC News reported Lester's Farm Chalet in St. John's is the first operation that lost hundreds of birds to avian flu before Christmas. More than 350 birds died there and another 60 birds, including geese, peacocks and an emu, were euthanized in an effort to contain the virus.The CFIA says 17 birds died at the 2nd location. Three were hens that were killed by the virus and the rest were ducks which were euthanized.Ireland said both locations had ponds where farm birds could mingle with wild birds, and both owners had chickens dying suddenly.The CFIA euthanized the surviving birds and drew out a 10-kilometre control zone around both facilities, putting them under quarantine. The agency says it continues to monitor wild and domestic birds through surveillance and sampling. Federal officials say they are also contacting farms and people with birds in the area to ask if any birds are showing signs of the disease.Ireland says the H5N1 strain of avian influenza which was identified can, on rare occasions, cause disease in humans.""It's almost always acquired through direct contact with infected birds and contaminated environments. Most human cases are limited to mild symptoms, like mild respiratory disease,"" said Ireland.""Some (avian flu) viruses can cause severe illness. So public health officials are recommending people avoid handling live or dead birds and they are also recommending against the feeding of wild birds like ducks, gulls and pigeons at local parks.""Ireland said the strain at the 2 locations has also been identified in wild birds in Newfoundland.""Through wild bird surveillance that has been undertaken by Environment and Climate Change Canada and the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, we found 2 birds with the same virus. So we know it is in some wild birds we have sampled,"" she said.Ireland called on people who keep birds to take steps to prevent them from becoming infected.""Whether you are a commercial poultry facility or whether you own a small, backyard flock, make sure you are keeping your domestic birds away from areas frequented by wild birds and maintain strict control over access to your birds and chicken coops,"" she said. ""Make sure equipment is cleaned and disinfected before taking it into your chicken coops or enclosures.""The CFIA suspects the source of infection at the 2 Avalon Peninsula locations is wild, aquatic, long-range, migratory birds but don't believe the virus has spread to the rest of Canada or North America.""There have been a number of outbreaks in Europe at commercial operations and in wild birds but we do not have evidence it is in other locations,"" said Ireland.[Byline: Mark Quinn]--Communicated by:ProMED[Hopefully, this disease is quickly contained and does not spread any further.""AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: the hemagglutinin, or H proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or N proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many strains of avian influenza (AI) virus exist worldwide. These viruses affect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl as well as a wide variety of free-flying species. Migratory waterfowl have been shown to be a natural reservoir for AI. AI strains also are divided into 2 groups based upon the ability of the virus to produce disease.""Low pathogenicity or ""low path"" avian influenza (LPAI)LPAI occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds. In most cases it causes no signs of infection or only minor symptoms in birds. These strains of the disease pose little significant threat to human health. These strains are common in the US and around the world.""Highly pathogenicity or 'high path' avian influenza (HPAI)HPAI is often fatal in chickens and turkeys. HPAI spreads rapidly and has a higher death rate in birds than LPAI. HPAI has been detected and eradicated 3 times in US domestic poultry. HPAI H5N1 is the subtype rapidly spreading in some parts of the world. Most of the highly pathogenic AI viruses fall under types H5 or H7; however, most AI infections, including those typed as H5 or H7, are clinically of low pathogenicity. These typically produce few or no clinical signs in affected birds. Sometimes the only evidence of this virus is a minor increase in bird mortality. Aside from the possible mutation of low-pathogenicity strains under field conditions into high-pathogenicity strains, the presence of low-pathogenicity virus can also result in restrictions on exports and serious repercussions on the production economy. Avian influenza of H5 and H7 subtypes are known as notifiable avian influenza (NAI). APHIS works to keep NAI from becoming established in US poultry populations.""Identifying infected birdsBirds infected with the HPAI virus may show one or more of the following signs:- sudden death without clinical signs;- lack of energy and appetite;- decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs;- swelling of head, comb, eyelid, wattles, and hocks;- purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs;- nasal discharge, coughing, and sneezing;- incoordination; or- diarrhea.""EpidemiologyHPAI can strike poultry quickly and spread rapidly from premises to premises. Migratory waterfowl can introduce the disease to US poultry. International visitors or smuggled birds are also risk factors. Once introduced, the disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contact with contaminated manure, equipment, vehicles, crates, and the clothing or shoes of individuals who have come in contact with the virus. The virus remains viable in the environment for long periods, particularly at lower temperatures, and it can survive indefinitely in frozen material.""Biosecurity measures on the farmVeterinarians should work with poultry producers to strengthen biosecurity practices. Established and enforced biosecurity protocols will help prevent introduction of HPAI and other infectious agents. ""Recommended biosecurity measures include- establishing an 'all-in, all-out' flock-management policy;- protecting against exposure to wild birds or water or ground contaminated by wild birds;- closing bird areas to nonessential personnel or vehicles; - providing employees with clean clothing and disinfection facilities and directions for their use;- thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting equipment and vehicles (including tires and undercarriage) when entering or leaving the farm;- banning the borrowing or lending of equipment or vehicles;- banning visits to other poultry farms, exhibitions, fairs, and sales or swap meets (if visits must occur, direct workers to change footwear and clothing on their return); and- banning bringing birds in slaughter channels back to the farm.""Reporting suspicious diseasesPractitioners are encouraged to educate their poultry clientele and pet bird owners to report all signs of disease.

Despite a significant decrease in both cases and outbreaks during the spring of 2021, HPAIV H5 was detected in waterfowl and birds of prey over the summer, especially in the Nordic countries of Europe. In Germany, since mid-October 2021, there have been hundreds of detections of HPAIV-infected wild birds as well as over 50 outbreaks in poultry and kept birds in numerous federal states. The risk of HPAIV H5 spreading in wild birds and transmission to poultry and kept birds in Germany is classified as high. It is strongly recommended that biosecurity measures in poultry holdings be reviewed and, if necessary, strengthened.A map of HPAI detections in Germany during the period of 1 Oct 2021 to 10 Jan 2022 can be seen at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_D/2022/Map_AI_D_2022-01-10.jpg. - Mod.CRDProMED maps:Bremen, Bremen, Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700846,9416Saarland, Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700846,17987] See Also

According to the Guangdong Provincial Health and Health Commission, the patient is a 43-year-old female from Zhongkai District, Huizhou City. The patient is currently in critical condition and is being admitted to a designated hospital in Huizhou. Health authorities were notified of the case on [7 Jan 2022]. Experts believe that the cases that appear this time are sporadic cases, and the risk of transmission of the virus is low at this stage. Experts remind: the public should continue to remain vigilant and take the following measures to prevent H5N6 and other bird flu. - Wash hands frequently: wash hands after touching birds, before meals and after toileting.- To be cooked: Poultry and eggs should be cooked before eating.- Seek medical treatment early: If you have respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, general malaise, etc., seek medical treatment at the nearest medical and health institution as soon as possible. If you have been in contact with birds before, you should take the initiative to tell your doctor.- Do not eat dead poultry.- Do not buy poultry products from unknown sources.- Avoid going to live poultry markets as much as possible.This is the 58th human H5N6 avian influenza case reported in China since 2014.--Communicated by:ProMED[To date, a total of 58 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus including 27 deaths have been reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region since 2014. The rise in numbers of reported human cases of A(H5N6) infection may reflect the continued circulation of the virus in birds, and enhanced surveillance system and diagnostic capacity as a direct outcome from the response to the COVID-19 pandemic (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20211224.pdf). The zoonotic threat remains elevated due to the spread of the viruses among birds. However, the overall pandemic risk associated with A(H5) is considered not significantly changed in comparison to previous years. WHO recommends Member States to remain vigilant and consider mitigation steps to reduce human exposure to potentially infected birds to reduce risk of additional zoonotic infections.For information about risk assessments on Avian Influenza, visit https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/avian-influenza/monthly-risk-assessment-summary (Assessment of risk associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N6) virus). - Mod.UBAProMED map:Guangdong Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700750,334] See Also

The case was in a mild condition and was not hospitalized. Prior to onset of illness, the case had exposure to a live poultry market and no further cases were suspected among family members at the time of reporting. To date [7 Jan 2022], 19 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported to WHO from China in 2021. As of 20 Dec 2021 and since 1998 a total of 95 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses have been reported: from China (83), Egypt (4), Bangladesh (3), Cambodia (1), Oman (1), Pakistan (1), India (1), and Senegal (1). Most of the cases were children with mild disease.--Communicated by:ProMED[Avian H9N2 influenza A viruses have caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5-year-old child in Hong Kong in 2003.Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission.The case was reported to WHO Western Pacific Region in the week between 17 Dec and 23 Dec 2021 and is included in the 2021 case count (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20211224.pdf?sfvrsn=223ca73f_171). The number of human infections with A/H9N2 avian influenza viruses reported from China has been higher in 2021 than in earlier years (20 cases, including the case in the above report). This is a cause for concern and highlights the need for continuous monitoring and risk assessments of these viruses with pandemic potential. - Mod.UBAProMED map:Guangdong Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700749,334] See Also

But generally, over the last 15 years or so, what we've seen with bird flu is we [the UK] get infection coming back in migrating wild birds, as do our European neighbors. The birds go to the north of Russia for the summer, and they mix with birds...and they all exchange the viruses and then head back to Europe in the winter and can then potentially directly infect our poultry, our kept birds, or can infect our wild birds.What generally we've been seeing is, every 2 to 3 years, a higher level of virus in the migratory wild birds. And we know that's there because we test them. We have a surveillance program that gives us an early warning of what's happening. That then translates into infection in kept poultry -- whether it's backyard poultry, animal sanctuaries, and sometimes commercial farms.... Last winter season [2020-2021], we had 26 infected premises in the UK, which was our biggest one ever. This year to date [7 Jan 2022], we're at 77. Back in 2003, the Netherlands had over 200 confirmed cases. So it does fluctuate.But in general, this year...we are seeing the highest number of confirmations we've ever had. Italy is at nearly 300 confirmations...Hungary is getting towards 100. It's doubled very recently, the numbers in France and the Netherlands. So what we're seeing across Western Europe really, [is] an increase [in] the number of cases, all being from this subtype H5N1.TS: Are there any ideas about why this year is different?CM: There's lots of theories, but there's no concrete evidence yet. And it is something we will be looking at.... Is it something to do with immunity within the wild birds? Is it something to do with the way they're mixing? And what's driving that? People have suggested it could be climate change, flight pathways...we don't know. So, lots of possibilities and it absolutely is something we will need to internationally look at further.TS: What does infection look like in birds?CM: The highly pathogenic H5N1, what that does is in kept birds -- particularly specific species [in] the Galliformes [order, such as] chickens and turkeys -- it can cause a variety of clinical signs...respiratory signs or neurological signs. They can have twisted necks. They can have discolored combs, and...kind of runny eyes and so on, and maybe diarrhea, and then often rapid death. You get a rapidly increasing mortality, generally, where you keep a large number of birds together. And you may note before that some reduction in food intake or water intake.... And that gives us a heads up. The owner, they report to us that they suspect they have a notifiable avian disease outbreak happening in the premises and we can investigate.TS: Do infections have any impacts on wild populations?CM: It does kill some species of wild birds depending on their infection level. We in the UK asked people to report in found dead wild birds and then we triage them. And some of them we will sample looking to check what has killed them. Is it avian flu? What subtype is it? What species are they? Are they a migratory species? Are they one of our own national wild birds? That helps us understand a bit more about where the infection is across the UK, and then the risk to our poultry.We started off in the autumn [2021], and we could see infection in Eastern Europe raising our risk level of incursion. We went through medium to high and now we're at a very high level of risk of incursion of infected wild birds into the UK. When we got to that level, we put in an avian influenza prevention zone requiring certain biosecurity actions of all bird keepers.... That means that there is a very high infection pressure out there. What we did next was to ask all bird keepers to house their birds, again to try and minimize any contact between them and that infected wild population. That risk level stress is across the whole of Great Britain. We've had infected wild birds detected in the north of the Isle of Skye in Scotland down to the south coast of England.TS: What are some economic effects of the outbreaks?CM: For individual keepers and companies, they're very serious. For people who keep backyard flocks...those infected birds may die. When we confirm infection, we will come in and cull the remaining birds because we need to protect other birds in a facility from getting infection. The same applies for commercial companies keeping birds.We do cull out all the birds on confirmed infected premises and go through a process of cleansing and disinfection. We will also trace all potential spread from that premises -- so, egg trucks, for example, hatcheries, [and] all these sorts of associated premises -- and put them under restriction and have additional requirements around biosecurity if we think there's any chance of disease spread.... If you're in the vicinity of an infected premise, you will be put under restriction and it makes going about daily business harder, because of the biosecurity requirements we put in place. [For example] licensing requirements [are] that you can't move things unless you get a license, and the license says you must do these following biosecurity steps to make it safe, and so on. It has very significant impacts for companies and individuals who keep birds.TS: Are there any efforts right now to develop vaccines or therapeutics for the animals?CM: There is a vaccine available for avian influenza, but like vaccines for human influenza in people, they're not 100% effective. In fact, in birds it's really not terribly effective, and it doesn't cover all the strains that might be out there. The strains change quite often when the birds mix over [the] north of Russia. We are worried about vaccinating birds with a vaccine that's not hugely effective.We do enable its use in some zoo animals under license in the UK, but it's not widely used. And because it's not hugely effective, it does have trade impacts because of the concern that it might mask infection, and the virus could still be there. Therefore, often trade partners wouldn't want to trade with you if you're using a vaccine. It's another area of potential science and research to look at more effective vaccines, but recognizing [that] the influenza virus, as we know from the human world, is a very difficult virus to produce a really effective vaccine for.TS: Are people at risk in general?CM: In terms of their own health, no. Our UK health authorities...have assessed the risk to the general public as very low. But we do advise that people should put in place routine hygiene precautions when they're handling their birds for their own safety.TS: Should the average person be concerned about this increase in outbreaks?CM: The general concern is that we've got this virus that is infecting birds and killing them. It has an economic impact that in itself has a wellbeing impact on those bird keepers. People should be concerned, particularly, if you're a bird keeper especially.The message to everybody is -- general public: don't worry, very low risk. Routine hygiene precautions. If you're a bird keeper, you need to be really, really scrupulously clean all the time.Editor's note: This interview has been edited for brevity.[Byline: Chloe Tenn]--Communicated by:ProMED[During the most recent meeting of EC's PAFF Committee on Animal Health & Welfare, held 15 Dec 2021, the following 9 countries presented their PowerPoint reports on HPAI in poultry and wildlife, covering the chronology, maps, surveillance and control measures, etc. Their respective links, and excerpted data on HPAI in wild birds, follow.

Mod.AS, edited]http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/article-print-page/.premium-MAGAZINE-1.10520867Prof. Ran Nathan, from the ""movement ecology laboratory"" at the Hebrew University, felt that something was wrong with the cranes as early as mid-December [2021]. For a decade he has been following them through transmitters that indicate their movements and location. When the avian flu epidemic broke out, 4 of the 10 cranes he was following ceased movement, and the remaining 6 showed alarming signs of a decline in activity levels, a phenomenon he had never seen before. ""At that time only 40 deaths among the cranes were observed,"" he says. ""I raised a shout that it was a huge event, and I hope this shout became helpful.""The outbreak -- which killed [in Israel] about 8000 cranes, other birds and more than a million poultry [including culled animals - Mod.AS] -- is unusual by any criteria. Avian influenza has been known for many years, and cases of mass infection and death are known to researchers, but these occur among flocks of chickens and other domestic birds, or in mixed communities of domestic and wild birds. In a flock composed exclusively of wild birds, such an event is very rare. ""There has never been such an outbreak, surely not among cranes,"" says Nathan.The question is how the virus will behave from now on. Are we back to the beginning of 2020, once again confronting a pandemic? Experts in Israel fear that spring migration will become the main engine for the spread of the virus in the coming months: hundreds of millions of birds returning from Africa to Europe will once again pass through the Hula Valley, catch the virus from other birds, from contaminated ground surface and water, potentially spread it throughout Eurasia. Dr. Ron Elazari-Volcani, a veterinarian at the zoological garden of the Tel Aviv University, warns: ""There is a mega-veterinary event here, not only at the national level but also internationally.""The main question at stake today is whether to continue feeding the cranes in the Hula Valley, as has been done for years to keep them limited to this location -- or to stop feeding to reduce the viral load in the Hula Valley ahead of spring, while probably risking a spread of the disease across the country with moving cranes. Nathan says: ""We must reach a situation where in mid-February [2022] we are prepared to take care of the infection centers. We have an international responsibility for what happens.""Eleazar-Volcani calls for drastic measures to reduce the risk of a global epidemic, even if these harm the flock of cranes in the Hula. ""The health of the migratory flyway passing through the Hula should be prioritized over interests of local chicken coops. This will need securing compensations to the farmers in case affected, while favouring freedom from infection among the huge number of birds that will move northwards from Africa in another 2 months. Feeding them should be stopped in order to decrease their density in the Hula Valley and preventing the breeding of infection. Clearing the area from the virus before spring migration arrives is essential. The disinfection of the contaminated feeding area should be considered. To deter the birds from landing and prevent them from grazing in the area during the spring, the installation of propane cannons or nylon coverage deserve being considered.""The Nature and Parks Authority, on the other hand, believes that there is no justification for stopping the feeding of the cranes, and fears that the infected birds will spread to other parts of the country in search of food. Regarding the consequences of spring migration, Uri Nave from the PA's science division says: ""During the spring there will be temperatures where the flu is less aggressive and there is a decrease in morbidity and mortality. It is also a migration with a different pattern -- the birds rush to the nesting sites in Europe and spend less time in Israel.""One of the factors that has influenced the outbreak of the plague is the global change in the migratory pattern of birds in recent decades. The birds' natural habitats disappeared, and humans provided them with new food sources. This is joined by climate change, which has made winters in Europe and the Middle East relatively warm and allowed the flocks to avoid or shorten their journey south.In the Hula, the change took place following the re-flooding of the reedbed in the 1990s and the shift of farmers in the area from growing cotton to grains such as corn, peanuts and chickpeas, which became food for cranes. With the increased crane population and because many preferred to winter in the country instead of continuing to Africa, the damage caused to farmers also worsened. This is when their feeding venture started.Experts admit that it is difficult to assess the consequences of the current outbreak, and that the lack of a formula for a perfect balance between bird protection and agricultural protection will make it difficult to prevent similar outbreaks. What remains is to learn how to deal more effectively with their consequences, for example, by systematically collecting carcasses at the center of the disease's outbreak.""We need one responsible agency who can make decisions,"" says Dr. Moti Charter of the University of Haifa, who yesterday [6 Jan 2022] documented the carcasses of birds of prey, including owls, falcons and buzzards in the Agamon Hula area. The main concern is the damage to rare birds such as white-tailed eagles, only 2 of which live in the Hula, white-headed ducks, or ferruginous ducks.The decision regarding the feeding of the cranes will have to be made in the coming months. ""I do not know if it is possible to return the genie into the bottle"", says Elazari-Vulcani, ""it remains only to try to reduce damage.""[Byline: Tzafrir Rinat and Nir Hasson]--Communicated by:ProMED[The continuing HPAI H5N1 panzootic, which started in the fall of 2021, has reportedly caused at least 3 other mass mortality events in wild birds:- Cormorants in Dyer Island, South Africa (https://mg.co.za/environment/2021-10-20-bird-flu-outbreak-on-dyer-island-causing-mass-deaths/);- Demoiselle cranes in Rajasthan, India (https://www.wti.org.in/news/wti-team-on-ground-as-avian-flu-hits-demoiselle-cranes-in-rajasthan/);- Barnacle geese in Solway Firth, Scotland (https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/bird-flu-fears-around-4000-deaths-in-biggest-outbreak-for-years-3501424; see 20220106.8700696).The HPAI H5N1 panzootic and its impact upon agriculture, public health and wildlife conservation prescribe the need for a One Health approach. - Mod.ASProMED maps:Europe: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700740,6010Israel: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700740,90] See Also

Additionally, the mixing of wild birds from different geographic origins during migration can increase the risk of virus spread and genetic reassortment resulting in changes in viral properties. At local level, as the AI viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, they can be easily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of infected animals, as well as contaminated boots, vehicles and equipment if adequate biosecurity measures are not implemented."" https://www.oie.int/en/disease/avian-influenza/#ui-id-2. - Mod.CRDProMED map:Portugal: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700705,42] See Also

The individual is currently well and self-isolating. The risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low.""Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare, according to the UKHSA.It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low.Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is also very rare, the organisation said.The case was detected after the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) identified an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in a flock of birds.The infected birds have all been culled. As a precaution, the UKHSA swabbed the person involved and detected low levels of flu.Further lab analysis showed that the virus was the ""H5"" type found in birds.The UKHSA said that, at this point, it has not been possible to confirm that this is a H5N1 infection (the strain that is currently circulating in birds in the UK).But the UKHSA has notified the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a precaution.It said this is the first human case of this strain in the UK, although there have been cases elsewhere globally.Professor Isabel Oliver, chief scientific officer at the UKHSA, said: ""While the risk of avian flu to the general public is very low, we know that some strains do have the potential to spread to humans and that's why we have robust systems in place to detect these early and take action.""Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely.""We have followed up all of this individual's contacts and have not identified any onward spread.""In December [2021], environment secretary George Eustice revealed the UK had been hit by a record outbreak of avian flu that led to 500 000 captive birds being culled in previous months.He told MPs an avian influenza prevention zone had been declared across the UK at the start of November [2021], requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors.On Wednesday [5 Jan 2022], the World Organisation for Animal Health warned a wave of bird flu in Asia and Europe had a greater risk of spreading to humans because of a high number of variants.The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza has raised concern among governments and the poultry industry after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds and trade restrictions.""This time the situation is more difficult and more risky because we see more variants emerge, which make them harder to follow,"" director general Monique Eloit told Reuters.""Eventually the risk is that it mutates or that it mixes with a human flu virus that can be transmitted between humans then suddenly it takes on a new dimension,"" she added.Fifteen countries had reported outbreaks of bird flu in poultry between October [2021] and the end of December [2021], mostly the H5N1 strain. Italy was the worst hit in Europe with 285 outbreaks and nearly 4 million birds culled, data showed.For contacts of an infected person who have the highest risk, the UKHSA contacts them daily to see if they have developed symptoms.People are also offered anti-viral treatment after exposure to infected birds to stop the virus reproducing in their body.Swabs are also carried out on people even if they do not have symptoms.Professor Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick, said: ""This is clearly going to be big news but the key thing is that human infections with H5N1 are really rare (fewer than 1000 worldwide since 2003) and they almost always occur as a result of direct, long-term contact with poultry.""It can result in a nasty infection for the individual concerned but there has never been any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 so at present I wouldn't consider this to be a significant public health risk.""Paul Wigley, professor of avian infection and immunity at the University of Liverpool, said: ""Whilst avian influenza has the potential to be transmitted from poultry to humans, it is very rare and, as in this case, usually due to close and long-term contact with infected birds.""Avian influenza such as the H5 serotype is largely adapted to infect birds and so is very unlikely to be transmitted from person to person.""The advice given by APHA and UKHSA over contact with infected birds is sensible and should be followed. The risk of wider infection in the general public remains low.""[Byline: Michael Howie]--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[This is the first human case of avian Influenza A/H5N1 reported from the United Kingdom. In 2006, 20 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) were reported in Azerbaijan (8 cases) and Turkey (12 cases). WHO/Europe, with international partners, supported the governments of Azerbaijan and Turkey in responding to the outbreaks. No human cases have been observed in the WHO European Region since that time, despite continued surveillance for this and other zoonotic influenza viruses (https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/influenza/zoonotic-influenza/old-links/human-infection-with-influenza-ah5n1). All human cases infected with a novel influenza strain are notifiable in the EU under EU legislation and the International Health Regulations (IHR) through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) and IHR, respectively. Human infections with A(H5N1) are notifiable according to EU Decisions 2012/506/EU and 1082/2013/EU (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/zoonotic-influenza/facts/factsheet-h5n1).This event overlaps the concurrent reports of a massive outbreak of avian influenza around the Solway Firth that has killed thousands of wildfowl in recent weeks, with over 4000 barnacle goose particularly affected/died, which equates to around 10% of the entire Svalbard population of the species (Avian influenza (09): Europe (UK) wild bird, HPAI, conservation concern 20220106.8700696).The primary risk factor for human infection with avian influenza is direct or indirect exposure to infected poultry (live or dead) or wildlife, as well as contaminated environments such as live bird markets. Additional risk factors include slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings.Given the potential zoonotic risk with this new case, contingency plans for the control of avian influenza in poultry and birds should be reviewed and implemented. Public health and animal health authorities must ensure that persons at risk are sufficiently protected from infection and appropriate measures are taken to prevent widespread transmission.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health, as well as timely sharing of viruses to inform risk assessments. - Mod.UBAOther URLs:- https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-first-brit-infected-bird-25872434- https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/01/06/first-case-human-h5-type-bird-flu-found-uk-public-warned-not/- https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/first-person-infected-bird-flu-25872620- https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/first-human-infected-bird-flu-6450808- https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/first-human-uk-infected-bird-22665123- https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10375255/Now-Britain-gets-hit-BIRD-FLU-Health-chiefs-detect-strain-person-South-West-England.html- https://www.mylondon.news/news/health/breaking-human-case-bird-flu-22665952- https://www.thejournal.ie/human-case-bird-flu-england-5647532-Jan2022/- https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/person-infected-bird-flu-england-22665365- https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1545885/bird-flu-case-england-uk-health-security-agencyFor information on HPAI H5N1 in humans (cases, deaths) since 2003 (18 countries), please refer to 'Table 2: Confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1)' at https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf.

The RSPB's reserve at Mersehead has been badly affected, with 700 corpses already removed from the site and numbers still rising.While barnacle geese are bearing the brunt of the outbreak, other species of wildfowl, including wintering whooper swans, have fallen victim, as have gulls, birds of prey, and Eurasian curlews. There is also growing concern for the Solway's wintering Northern Lapwings and Eurasian Wigeon.The RSPB says that it is in desperate need of more trained staff and equipment to aid with the safe removal of dead birds and to help to reduce the risk of the virus spreading and killing more healthy birds. The organisation has launched an urgent fundraising appeal and is asking for any donations that the public may be able to spare.While risk of transmission to humans is low, NHS advice to members of the public is not to handle any dead birds they come across in the field.--Communicated by:ProMED[Outbreaks of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses have been causing deaths in wild birds in Europe since 2014. Mass mortalities like this one reported in barnacle geese (_Branta leucopsis_) are a concern for the conservation of some bird species. The barnacle goose is not an endangered species, but mass mortality involving a large proportion of a population may determine its decline. - Mod.PMBProMED map:Solway Firth,  Scotland, United Kingdom: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700696,3762] See Also

During each of the previous epizootics, in 2006 and 2015, less than 10 outbreaks on commercial farms were recorded. Similar to the previous events, and in line with observations elsewhere (see citation below), turkey farms have become the most affected. In difference with previous events, table-egg layers have been included among the affected farms during the current event. A total of over a million birds had to be killed; the issue has become widely published and subject to discussions at the state's highest level (see https://www.timesofisrael.com/bennett-holds-security-meeting-on-bird-flu-outbreak-as-disease-continues-to-spread/).The current event included a devastating outbreak among migrating cranes in northern Israel, killing more than 5200 of them.

""It is sad that we now have to kill so many animals again, and at the same time, a great loss of resources for society.""The task will take several days to complete, and the work is being carried out in a collaboration between the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and the Danish Emergency Management Agency. Once the task is completed, the entire property will be cleaned and disinfected, the press release added.Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a type of zoonotic (or animal) influenza that affects wild birds and poultry, according to the World Health Organization. It has occasionally infected humans; however, it does not easily transmit between humans.The majority of human cases of avian influenza have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry.Since it was first reported in Hong Kong in 1997, the disease has been responsible for human outbreaks and deaths in 16 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.[Byline: Burak Bir]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[The panzootic of HPAI H5N1, starting in the fall of 2021 in Eurasia, has already spread, mainly by migrating birds, into Africa and, most recently, to America (wild birds in Canada, ProMED post 20220103.8700643).The following timeline of HPAI H5N1 in Denmark is based upon information available on the website of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA; https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/english/Animal/AnimalHealth/Animal%20diseases/Avian_influenza/Pages/default.aspx).- 22 Oct 2021: HPAI H5N1 detected in wild birds in Denmark.

In a statement from the City of St. John's on Friday [31 Dec 2021], officials said Environment Canada had confirmed that influenza H5N1 has been found in wild birds in areas like Bowring Park, Quidi Vidi Lake, and other areas frequented by flocks of birds.""Like our human flu, it has variants we refer to as highly pathogenic, meaning that they cause illness and death in birds getting infected with them,"" said Ian Jones, a biology professor at Memorial University.The city has asked residents not to feed, touch, or handle wild birds, including ducks, pigeons, and gulls.Cases of H5N1 were first identified on the island around mid-December [2021] on an exhibition farm on the island, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and a report from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Jones said the flu circulates naturally in birds, with higher case numbers in Europe signalling a higher risk for North American poultry flocks this year [2021-2022]. The disease is often found in birds such as chickens, turkeys, quails, and guinea fowl, as well as pet and wild birds.Jones suspects the flu could have come from Europe in recent months, as some species of geese not usually seen in North America have been found in the province following an October [2021] windstorm. ""It was a major system filling almost the entire North Atlantic, producing very strong winds from northern Europe straight across and then down to Newfoundland, including the Avalon Peninsula. Migrating waterfowl, especially geese from Europe, were caught up in this,"" he said.""Birdwatchers have observed in eastern Canada an unprecedented number of barnacle geese and pink-footed geese, 2 European geese species which don't normally occur here."" Jones said the risk of humans getting the disease is low, and it would involve dealing with the insides of infected animals. The biggest risk, Jones said, comes in agriculture and the poultry industry.The exhibition farm where the disease was first identified doesn't produce birds for sale, the agency said, adding it won't have an effect on poultry trade. The farm was under quarantine, which included a 10 km [6.2 mi] zone with movement control measures and enhanced biosecurity to limit the potential spread of the disease.According to the OIE, 419 birds were identified to be carrying the flu. Of those, 360 died, while 59 had to be euthanized.In a statement to CBC News earlier this month [December 2021], Country Ribbon -- the province's largest poultry producer -- said production wouldn't be affected, and strict monitoring was taking place to ensure safety at their farms.--communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>******[2]Date: Fri 31 Dec 2021Source: The Star [edited]https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/12/31/nl-biologist-says-avian-flu-in-st-johns-very-concerning-for-birds-not-humans.htmlA biologist in Newfoundland and Labrador says the discovery of the highly pathogenic avian flu in St John's birds is ""very concerning"" for bird populations, but likely not for humans. Memorial University professor Andrew Lang said in an interview on Friday [31 Dec 2021] the flu could be devastating for North America's wild bird populations if it manages to spread beyond the island of Newfoundland.The City of St John's said in a news release Friday [31 Dec 2021] the flu had been found in local wild birds and officials asked residents not to feed, handle, or touch any birds, including gulls, ducks, and pigeons. Environment Canada wildlife scientist Alan Hanson said in an interview Friday [31 Dec 2021] the flu was found in a great black-backed gull found at a St John's pond on 26 Nov [2021].The news comes just days after an outbreak of H5N1 avian flu was reported at an ""exhibition farm"" on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula, which killed 360 of the facility's 419 birds.Lang says there is ""little or no evidence"" the strain poses a risk for humans, noting it has shown up in several other parts of the world, such as Israel, where an outbreak recently killed more than 5000 migratory cranes. Lang said the current strain is particularly well adapted to spread among wild birds, as it kills many but leaves some alive. Those infected birds can then go on to spread the virus. He said it's hard to predict what will happen in Newfoundland. ""Best case scenario? Maybe it never leaves the island,"" he said. ""Maybe it'll just vanish; maybe we'll be lucky.""As for the infected gull, Hanson said it was collected at Mundy Pond, in the western part of the capital, and it was brought to wildlife officials because it was behaving strangely. The bird died about 24 hours after it was brought in, he said.--communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[The arrival of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a serious situation. We are saddened to learn of the storm, and the likely transport of this disease. Certainly, we hope this disease is quickly contained and does not spread.""AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: the hemagglutinin, or H proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or N proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many strains of avian influenza (AI) virus exist worldwide. These viruses affect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl as well as a wide variety of free-flying species. Migratory waterfowl have been shown to be a natural reservoir for AI. AI strains also are divided into 2 groups based upon the ability of the virus to produce disease.""Low pathogenicity or ""low path"" avian influenza (LPAI)LPAI occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds. In most cases it causes no signs of infection or only minor symptoms in birds. These strains of the disease pose little significant threat to human health. These strains are common in the US and around the world.""Highly pathogenicity or 'high path' avian influenza (HPAI)HPAI is often fatal in chickens and turkeys. HPAI spreads rapidly and has a higher death rate in birds than LPAI. HPAI has been detected and eradicated 3 times in US domestic poultry. HPAI H5N1 is the subtype rapidly spreading in some parts of the world. Most of the highly pathogenic AI viruses fall under types H5 or H7; however, most AI infections, including those typed as H5 or H7, are clinically of low pathogenicity. These typically produce few or no clinical signs in affected birds. Sometimes the only evidence of this virus is a minor increase in bird mortality. Aside from the possible mutation of low-pathogenicity strains under field conditions into high-pathogenicity strains, the presence of low-pathogenicity virus can also result in restrictions on exports and serious repercussions on the production economy. Avian influenza of H5 and H7 subtypes are known as notifiable avian influenza (NAI). APHIS works to keep NAI from becoming established in US poultry populations.""Identifying infected birdsBirds infected with the HPAI virus may show one or more of the following signs:- sudden death without clinical signs;- lack of energy and appetite;- decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs;- swelling of head, comb, eyelid, wattles, and hocks;- purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs;- nasal discharge, coughing, and sneezing;- incoordination; or- diarrhea.""EpidemiologyHPAI can strike poultry quickly and spread rapidly from premises to premises. Migratory waterfowl can introduce the disease to US poultry. International visitors or smuggled birds are also risk factors. Once introduced, the disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contact with contaminated manure, equipment, vehicles, crates, and the clothing or shoes of individuals who have come in contact with the virus. The virus remains viable in the environment for long periods, particularly at lower temperatures, and it can survive indefinitely in frozen material.""Biosecurity measures on the farmVeterinarians should work with poultry producers to strengthen biosecurity practices. Established and enforced biosecurity protocols will help prevent introduction of HPAI and other infectious agents. Recommended biosecurity measures include- establishing an 'all-in, all-out' flock-management policy;- protecting against exposure to wild birds or water or ground contaminated by wild birds;- closing bird areas to nonessential personnel or vehicles; - providing employees with clean clothing and disinfection facilities and directions for their use;- thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting equipment and vehicles (including tires and undercarriage) when entering or leaving the farm;- banning the borrowing or lending of equipment or vehicles;- banning visits to other poultry farms, exhibitions, fairs, and sales or swap meets (if visits must occur, direct workers to change footwear and clothing on their return); and- banning bringing birds in slaughter channels back to the farm.""Reporting suspicious diseasesPractitioners are encouraged to educate their poultry clientele and pet bird owners to report all signs of disease. If signs of disease resemble AI or cannot be diagnosed, they should immediately be reported to both the assistant district director and the state animal health official.""(https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/NVAP-Reference-Guide/Poultry/Avian-Influenza) - Mod.TGProMED map of Newfoundland, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700643,375.] See Also

October is a month during which [a major bird migration] passes over the country on their migration from Europe to Africa, including water-birds. Around the affected farms, there are some water bodies where wild birds can rest and feed. The distance between Ein Zurim and Avigedor events is about 2.5 kilometers. The outbreak in MARGALYYOT is the first outbreak in Israel that occurred in laying hens. The area near the northern border, is populated with a large number of laying hen pens.""This epizootic has involved a major event among migrating cranes, residing in the Hula valley, north Israel (see earlier postings, and https://news.in-24.com/news/446377.html).

The Agriculture Ministry reported virus clusters at 26 factory farms, mainly in the south west -- home to France's lucrative foie gras pate industry -- as well as 15 cases in wild fowl and 3 in backyards.The government ordered farmers in November 2021 to keep poultry indoors in a bid to stop the spread of the virus by migratory birds, though the 1st case was detected later that month, at a site in the north. The 1st case to strike the south west, where most outbreaks are now located, came on 16 Dec 2021, the ministry said.Last winter more than 500 farms experienced massive infections that resulted in the culling of some 3.5 million birds, mainly ducks, prompting the government to spend millions of euros in compensation.

The cases were detected primarily along the coast. FLI also recorded 46 infections at German poultry farms.In the same timeframe across Europe, the FLI data showed 675 infections in wild birds and 534 infections in livestock. There were also additional cases in mammals this year [2021], for example, among red foxes in the Netherlands and Finland, grey seals in Sweden, harbor seals in Germany and otters in Finland.In the Czech Republic, authorities said on Tuesday [28 Dec 2021] that some 80 000 hens were due to be culled after more than 100 000 animals died of bird flu since late last week. The farm in Libotenice, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Prague, had a total of 188 000 hens before Christmas. ""The culling of hens from halls affected by bird flu is under way,"" State Veterinary Administration spokesperson Petr Majer told Agence France-Presse (AFP). ""The numbers show that this strain, the highly pathogenic H5N1, is very aggressive and kills hens in particular fast and on a mass scale,"" he added. He said vets would also destroy over a million eggs from the farm.The Czech Republic has registered 48 outbreaks of bird flu this year [2021], the highest number in a calendar year in history. The disease is currently plaguing Europe, with France reporting an outbreak in its foie gras producing Landes region last week. ""Clinical signs leave no doubt and it was decided to cull the flock"" on Saturday [18 Dec 2021], the day after the outbreak was identified, Marie-Helene Cazaubon, head of the Landes chamber of agriculture, said nearly 2 weeks ago.Local authorities have established a 3-kilometer [1.8 mi] protection zone and a 10-kilometer [6.2 mi] surveillance zone around the farm. It is the 2nd outbreak detected in the south west since a major epidemic last year [2020] led to the culling of 2.5 million ducks and geese.Early last month [November 2021] health authorities asked organic and open-air poultry raisers to confine their fowl as a measure to avoid contact with migratory birds that might carry the virus. ""We are in a migratory corridor through which birds fly from northern Europe...and we must be very vigilant,"" said Cazaubon, herself a duck farmer. Cazaubon noted that most of the ducks and geese have already been slaughtered for their fatty liver, to be made into the famous foie gras pate popular during the holiday season. The tradition runs deep in France, but it is controversial because the birds are force-fed in order to fatten their livers artificially. About a quarter of French foie gras comes from Landes, which counts around 800 farms, mainly raising ducks.Another outbreak of bird flu has been detected in a rural county in East Anglia in England. According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the H5N1 was found in the Watlington area, near King's Lynn. Temporary 3-kilometer [1.8 mi] and 10-kilometer [6.2 mi] surveillance zones have been deployed around the affected areas. A previous case of avian influenza was found in poultry at Holkham. Two cases of avian influenza were detected in Essex last month [November 2021].--communicated by:ProMED******[3] UK: commercial poultry farms, spreadDate: Thu 30 Dec 2021 07:00 GMTSource: The Poultry Site [edited]https://www.thepoultrysite.com/news/2021/12/uk-confirms-two-new-cases-of-avian-influenzaHighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was confirmed on Tuesday [28 Dec 2021] in 2 commercial poultry facilities, one near Watlington in Norfolk, the other near North Somercotes in Lincolnshire.

All farms have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after culling farmed birds. Adjacent farms within 3 km of the infected farms will be under strengthened surveillance for a period of 3 months. Suspected signs were observed in poultry carcasses during postmortem inspection in the abattoir in Pingtung County. Samples were sent to the Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for diagnosis. Novel H5N2 subtype HPAI was confirmed by the AHRI. The carcasses were destroyed, and thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted in the abattoir.

A spokeswoman said there had never been such an avian flu outbreak among wild birds.The Agriculture Ministry has said that the farmers on the moshav failed to report the outbreak in real time, allowing it to spread like wildfire.The Hula Reserve will remain closed to the public until [1 Jan 2021].Members of the public are advised to cook eggs and poultry meat thoroughly before eating, to avoid contact with wild birds or their excrement, and to call the INPA on *3639 if they see any signs of sick or dead birds.[Byline: Sue Surkes]--Communicated by:ProMED******[3] Table egg supply, public health concernsDate: Sun 26 Dec 2021Source: Poultrymed [in Hebrew, trans. Mod.AS, edited] https://www.poultrymed.com/Poultrymed/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=2&TMID=178&FID=14756&PID=0&IID=43398The Haaretz daily published today (26 Dec 2021) a headline announcing apprehension that eggs from birds infected with bird flu had reached IDF [Israel's army] bases. As is well known, the [named] farm in Moshav Margaliot supplies the IDF with eggs from its laying farms. The outbreak of bird flu in Moshav Margaliot spread from the center of the moshav [cooperative village] to the egg-laying enterprise of the said firm next to the moshav, and now it is feared that eggs from an infected farm have reached the table of IDF soldiers.What is the risk?Avian influenza viruses, defined as pathogenic, can contaminate the contents of the egg in addition to external contamination of the shell. Therefore, these eggs have the potential for spreading infection (scientific references attached). At the same time, it is reported that the Ministry of Agriculture has approved egg imports (14 million) for fear of shortage. It must be noted that this import measure was approved even before the outbreak of bird flu in Moshav Margaliot. The Poultry Industry Council recommends approving imports amounting to 70 million eggs.There aren't many import options since most European countries are also infected with bird flu (except Spain), including Ukraine (early December 2021, outbreak in a poultry farm in the Kherson oblast).[The report includes 4 citations which are available at the source URL]. --Communicated by:ProMED [According to an update in Poultrymed, 26 Dec 2021, 2 additional HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry (turkey farms) have recently been identified by the State Veterinary Services. One, in Ein-Hachoresh, central Israel (19-week-old turkeys); the other one, in the Givat Yoav moshav, on the Golan Heights. This outbreak is situated about 2 km [1.2 mi] as the crow flies from an earlier outbreak, reported last week in Neot Golan, which similarly kept 13.6-week-old turkeys. Both are about 35 km [21.7 mi] distant, on their north northeast, from the Hula Lake reserve (crane outbreak) and 48 km [29.8 km] from Margaliot (map at <tinyurl.com/2e2z6phj>). The epidemiological aspects of this unusual event are yet to be studied at depth, preferably incorporating animal health, public health, environmental, ornithology and farming experts. Among the issues to be investigated are the route of the pathogen's initial introduction to the region, its timeline, in particular poultry-infecting-wildlife or vice versa route(s), and the impact of wildlife (feeding) and poultry (small, numerous, dense coops) managements upon the disastrous disease/mortality both in cranes and on farms, respectively. The conclusions and recommendations of such inquiry are of significance, not only for the farming industry and environmentalists but for the public at large. Since the start of the current HPAI H5N1 panzootic, in September 2021, vast regions in Europe and Asia have been affected; fortunately, not a single human case has, so far, been reported. - Mod.ASProMED map:Israel: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700508,90] See Also

The General Directorate of Food and Veterinary Medicine (DGAV) has already activated a contingency plan, establishing, among others, the slaughter of affected animals and a sanitary restriction around the affected area, within a radius of up to 10 kilometers [6.2 mi]. At issue is a ""highly pathogenic avian flu"", with very high mortality rates, and which can infect other animals and also humans, when there is very close contact.However, DGAV stresses that ""there is no epidemiological evidence of avian influenza transmission to humans through food consumption, namely poultry meat and eggs"".To prevent the spread of the disease, a protection zone and a surveillance zone were defined, covering respectively 3 and 10 kilometer radii around the poultry farm. The DGAV banned the circulation of live birds in the restriction area, but also that of fresh meat, including offal and poultry meat products. The same applies to the circulation of eggs for hatching and for human consumption, as well as animal by-products obtained from birds originating from production in the affected area.The contingency plan provides for the elimination of infected birds, with compensation being made for the sanitary slaughter of the animals. The measures apply until 27 Jan 2022, and poultry farms in this zone will be subject to inspection.--Communicated by:ProMED [The previous HPAI H5N1 outbreak of the current season, in Portugal, started on 30 Nov 2021 and was reported to the OIE on 6 Dec 2021 (item 3 in ProMED post 20211209.8700162). It affected a backyard hobby flock of chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese located in the province of Setubal (map at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=43980). The current event is located in the district of Leiria. Both areas are situated in western Portugal, respectively south and north of the Lisbon district (map at https://www.mappr.co/counties/portugal/). The current epizootic of HPAI H5N1 has spread, since its start (September 2021), throughout most parts of Europe, in several countries in Asia and, to a lesser extent, Africa.

The farm does not produce birds for sale. The federal agency says the provincial department and the owner are working with CFIA to manage the situation. The infected birds were located on the farm, which contains a variety of other species of animals. No other cases resembling Avian Flu have been reported in the vicinity of the farm. The CFIA says Avian Flu circulates naturally in birds and recent detections of high pathogenic AI in Europe indicate an even higher risk of the disease in North American poultry this year [2021]. The federal agency says it is important anyone raising poultry remain vigilant against AI and ensure they have effective biosecurity measures in place.--Communicated by:ProMED******[2]Date: Thu 23 Dec 2021Source: OFFLU [edited]https://www.offlu.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OFFLU-statement_Newfoundland__H5N1.pdfOFFLU statement on outbreak of H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza in Newfoundland, Canada--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The recent detection of an H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus in Newfoundland, Canada represents the first identification of goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage (Gs/GD/96) H5 HPAI virus in the Americas since June 2015. This is cause for concern for wild birds, zoological collections, and poultry in the Americas(1). Some east coast states of the United States of America (USA) are home to very large poultry populations that could be at risk of exposure and outbreaks in the next few months. This finding raises concerns about the potential of this virus becoming established in the Americas within migratory and resident birds.Epidemiological information on the HPAI outbreak is limited. It involved an exhibition farm in St John's on the Avalon Peninsula and resulted in the death of 360 of 409 mixed species of birds (layers, geese, ducks, silkie hens, peafowl, turkeys) kept on the farm. Full genome sequence of the virus was obtained from 9 clinical samples collected from the infected premises. Based on BLAST analysis all 8 gene segments of the virus are of Eurasian origin. The virus has been confirmed as a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus, phylogenetically all 8 gene segments of the virus are related to 2.3.4.4b clade H5N1 virus currently circulating widely in wild birds and poultry in Europe. The outbreak commenced on 9 Dec 2021. This is the first time that a clade 2.3.4.4b virus within the goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage (Gs/GD/96) has been detected in the Americas. The remaining birds in the farm were depopulated and the Canadian authorities are continuing investigations, including additional testing of wild birds and poultry in the area.High pathogenicity Gs/GD/96-lineage H5 virus was last introduced to North America in late 2014 and caused the largest animal health emergency in the USA during 2015. That virus arrived from Asia across the Bering Strait, belonged to clade 2.3.4.4c, and, initially, affected birds on the west coast of Canada and the USA. The current Newfoundland outbreak represents a new introduction of a different, but phylogenetically related, high pathogenicity virus. This virus lineage has shown to be capable of being carried over long distances by migratory birds, based on experiences from Eurasia and Africa.It has been recognised for some time that, although avian influenza viruses tend to be classified into North American and Eurasian lineages, viral genes and, on occasions, whole viruses can cross the Atlantic divide (Dusek et al., 2014). The introduction of a Gs/GD/96-lineage H5 HPAI via this route was considered possible previously (Sims et al., 2017). We postulate that a wild bird introduction might have occurred in the current outbreak (direct or indirect), although other pathways cannot be ruled out. If this is the result of wild bird introduction, experiences from Eurasia suggest that rapid and wide dispersal of the virus could occur. There are few poultry in the Maritime provinces of Canada, which means there is a limited population of susceptible poultry that could provide a warning of wider transmission of the virus by wild birds.We urge all countries in the Americas and Caribbean to increase surveillance of wild birds and poultry for any evidence of infection with this virus, and, also, advise poultry producers and keepers of other types of birds to implement stricter biosecurity measures until more information becomes available.References:Dusek RJ, Hallgrimsson GT, Ip HS, Jónsson JE, Sreevatsan S, Nashold SW, TeSlaa JL, EnomotoS, Halpin RA, Lin X, Fedorova N, Stockwell TB, Dugan VG, Wentworth DE, Hall JS.

Many strains of avian influenza (AI) virus exist worldwide. These viruses affect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl as well as a wide variety of free-flying species. Migratory waterfowl have been shown to be a natural reservoir for AI. AI strains also are divided into 2 groups based upon the ability of the virus to produce disease. ""Low Pathogenicity or ""low path"" Avian Influenza (LPAI)LPAI occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds. In most cases it causes no signs of infection or only minor symptoms in birds. These strains of the disease pose little significant threat to human health. These strains are common in the U.S. and around the world.""Highly Pathogenicity or ""high path"" Avian Influenza (HPAI) HPAI is often fatal in chickens and turkeys. HPAI spreads rapidly and has a higher death rate in birds than LPAI. HPAI has been detected and eradicated 3 times in U.S. domestic poultry. HPAI H5N1 is the subtype rapidly spreading in some parts of the world. Most of the highly pathogenic AI viruses fall under types H5 or H7; however, most AI infections, including those typed as H5 or H7, are clinically of low pathogenicity. These typically produce few or no clinical signs in affected birds. Sometimes the only evidence of this virus is a minor increase in bird mortality. Aside from the possible mutation of low-pathogenicity strains under field conditions into high-pathogenicity strains, the presence of low-pathogenicity virus can also result in restrictions on exports and serious repercussions on the production economy. Avian Influenza of H5 and H7 subtypes are known as Notifiable Avian Influenza (NAI). APHIS works to keep NAI from becoming established in U.S. poultry populations. ""Identifying Infected BirdsBirds infected with the HPAI virus may show one or more of the following signs:•	Sudden death without clinical signs;•	Lack of energy and appetite;•	Decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs;•	Swelling of head, comb, eyelid, wattles, and hocks;•	Purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs;•	Nasal discharge, coughing, and sneezing;•	Incoordination; or•	Diarrhea. ""EpidemiologyHPAI can strike poultry quickly and spread rapidly from premises to premises. Migratory waterfowl can introduce the disease to U.S. poultry. International visitors or smuggled birds are also risk factors. Once introduced, the disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contact with contaminated manure, equipment, vehicles, crates, and the clothing or shoes of individuals who have come in contact with the virus. The virus remains viable in the environment for long periods, particularly at lower temperatures, and it can survive indefinitely in frozen material. ""Biosecurity Measures on the FarmVeterinarians should work with poultry producers to strengthen biosecurity practices. Established and enforced biosecurity protocols will help prevent introduction of HPAI and other infectious agents. Recommended biosecurity measures include•	Establishing an ""all-in, all-out"" flock-management policy;•	Protecting against exposure to wild birds or water or ground contaminated by wild birds;•	Closing bird areas to nonessential personnel or vehicles; •	Providing employees with clean clothing and disinfection facilities and directions for their use;•	Thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting equipment and vehicles (including tires and undercarriage) when entering or leaving the farm;•	Banning the borrowing or lending of equipment or vehicles;•	Banning visits to other poultry farms, exhibitions, fairs, and sales or swap meets (if visits must occur, direct workers to change footwear and clothing on their return); and•	Banning bringing birds in slaughter channels back to the farm. ""Reporting Suspicious DiseasesPractitioners are encouraged to educate their poultry clientele and pet bird owners to report all signs of disease. If signs of disease resemble AI or cannot be diagnosed, they should immediately be reported to both the Assistant District Director and the State Animal Health Official.""Extracted from: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/NVAP-Reference-Guide/Poultry/Avian-Influenza. - Mod.TGProMED map:Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700481,22883] See Also

Regarding infection of these viruses in mammals, recently, HPAI H5N8 infections were reported in humans in Russia (see ProMED post 20210221.8204014). Several subtypes of AI viruses (H7N7, H4N5, H4N6, H3N3, and H10N7) have caused epidemics in harbour seals and gray seals, but they do not appear to become established in these carnivore species. Regarding terrestrial carnivores, red foxes have been shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1, and there was recent documentation of a spill-over of HPAI H5N8 to wild carnivores. Virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMBProMED map:Kärdla, Hiiumaa, Estonia: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700432,68643] See Also

It's the second reported case in a month.Now, Cheshire West and Chester Council, Defra, APHA and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) are putting several measures in place to help prevent this from happening. This includes a 3 km [approx. 1.86 mi] Protection Zone and a 10 km [approx. 6 mi] Surveillance Zone, while owners have been reminded that all poultry and captive birds in the 3 km [approx. 1.86 mi] Protection Zone must be kept inside unless otherwise directed by a veterinary inspector.The zones restrict access to locations where birds are kept and impose restrictions on the movement of birds but don't limit access to residents or business owners.[Byline: Milo Clay]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The 1st detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in the UK during the current, continuing epizootic was in rescued swans and captive poultry at a swan sanctuary in Worcester (England) on 15 Oct 2021. A steadily increasing number of HPAI H5N1-infected wild birds, countywide, has been reported since, followed by introductions into poultry farms, of which the most recent one is addressed in the above media report. DEFRA published its 6th update of 'HPAI in the UK and Europe Outbreak Assessment' on 16 Dec 2021. The (16 pages) report includes a map and 2 detailed tables, presenting the outbreaks in poultry farms and in captive and wild birds as of 13 Dec 2021. The document is available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1041537/hpai-europe-211213.pdf. The conclusions (abridged) follow.""New cases of HPAI H5 in wild birds and outbreaks in poultry continue to be reported in northern Europe including in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Total numbers of migrating wild waterbirds (ducks, geese, and some swan species) may now be peaking in GB and the majority of wintering waterbirds have now arrived.""Multiple confirmed cases of HPAI H5 in wild birds (235 to 13 Dec 2021) across a range of species, including resident sedentary species such as raptors and mute swan indicating that they had been exposed to infection in GB. Furthermore, potential bridging species such as gulls and raptors have tested positive. More wild bird HPAI H5 infections are expected including in sedentary GB species and potential bridging species. HPAI H5 will continue to circulate in both susceptible migrant water birds and sedentary bird species within the UK over the next few months, with a greater number of events likely to be observed around water bird wintering sites. ""The risk level of HPAI H5 in wild birds is therefore maintained at VERY HIGH across GB. The risk of exposure of poultry across the whole GB is maintained at MEDIUM (with low uncertainty) where good biosecurity is applied, and at HIGH (with low uncertainty) where biosecurity is suboptimal. This assessment takes into consideration the Avian Influenza Protection Zone (AIPZ) and assumes that bird keepers are taking the additional biosecurity measures required.""On 24 Nov 2021, the Chief Veterinary Officers for England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland announced housing measures, which came into force on 29 Nov 2021. It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers to keep their birds indoors, to exclude contact with wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease"".

Traffic restrictions on the entry of trucks and equipment into the poultry farms were imposed in the area, and anyone engaged with poultry elsewhere was instructed not to approach the coop complexes.The Veterinary Services fear that they will have to prepare for the extermination of about half a million [240 000, according to other media reports] laying hens in order to prevent the spread of bird flu. The source of the disease is probably in the [migrating] cranes that brought the virus with them to the Hula valley [but see comment below]. Due to the avian influenza outbreak, the entrance of hikers to the Hula Lake Park [known in Hebrew as Agamon HaHula] and to the vicinity of the cranes has been closed.This incident is accompanied by poultry mortality and requires culling and complete isolation until the event's termination is officially announced. This was informed to the owners of the poultry farms and the residents of [the regional Councils] Mevoot Hermon, Merom Hagalil and Ma'ale Yosef.To prevent the spread of the disease, poultry breeders in the Upper Galilee have been instructed to refrain from reaching Margaliot in the coming days to prevent vehicles and trucks that had visited Margaliot, in particular those engaged in the supply of feed concentrates, from entering their premises, and to immediately notify any signs of disease or increased mortality among their birds. The Ministry of Agriculture also instructed the growers to refrain from allowing manure removal contractors to approach the poultry farms until the announcement of the event termination.The source of the outbreak is said to be a disease event in the Hula Lake Park [Agamon; see map at <tinyurl.com/2p9fu9dp>], which started last weekend, where hundreds of cranes were affected by bird flu and many died. The management of the Agamon said that they are constantly in contact with the professionals in the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture to find a solution to the issue [see comment below].--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>******[2] Laying hens, migrating cranesDate: Sat 18 Dec 2021 08:52 ISTSource: Davar [in Hebrew, machine trans., edited]https://www.davar1.co.il/350513/The Ministry of Agriculture updated the Ministry of Health yesterday [Fri 17 Dec 2021] on dozens of cranes infected with bird flu that were discovered in the Hula Valley. The Ministry of Health asks not to approach the migratory birds and to avoid contact.The initial suspicion arose following an abnormal mortality of cranes at the site. Following this, samples were collected by the Nature and Parks Authority and sent to the Veterinary Institute's laboratory at the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary Services, which showed that wild birds were infected with H5N1 bird flu due to widespread morbidity. The Ministry of Agriculture regularly updates the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health).This case joins other recent cases in which H5N1 avian influenza has been identified in wild birds. According to a report published by the (acting) Director of Veterinary Services, Dr. Tamir Goshen, many cases of wild bird disease have been diagnosed recently in several places in the country, including Moshav Hayogev in the Jezreel Valley, Agmon Hahula, Kibbutz Migdal Oz in Gush Etzion and Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon in the Hefer Valley. The current outbreak was detected in wild birds a few weeks ago, and so far has been diagnosed in cranes, pelicans and marbled ducks.The Ministry of Agriculture also said that all avian influenza events this year [2021], as well as the current one, involved an H5N1 virus that could cause a low risk of human disease. This case joins other recent cases in which H5N1 bird flu has been identified on [5] poultry farms in Kfar Baruch, Kibbutz Ein Tzurim, Avigdor, Maayan Zvi and Nahalal. These events have been long resolved.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[The distance between Margaliot (adjacent to the Lebanese border) and the Agamon, on its southeast, is 13.20 km (8.20 mi).The route and direction of introduction of the HPAI H5N1 into Israel and into the poultry farms (hen-to-crane or rather vice versa), and the reason(s) of the severe disease, including mass mortality among the cranes, an event not seen before in a location visited by 5-digit number of migrating cranes each November, are yet to be investigated and clarified. One hypothesis could be the cranes' possible susceptibility, becoming infected in this bird-crowded meeting site from co-visiting infected migrating waterbirds of the order Anseriformes, the latter known to remain subclinical while infective. A One Health approach, incorporating animal health, public health, and ornithologists, is warranted.The Hula Valley is an agricultural region in northern Israel with abundant fresh water, which used to be Lake Hula, prior to its draining. Lake Hula and the marshland surrounding it were a breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying malaria, and so were drained in the 1950s. A small section of the valley was later re-flooded in an attempt to revive a nearly extinct ecosystem.Hula Lake Park, known in Hebrew as Agamon HaHula, is located in the southern part of the Hula Valley. The new site has become the 2nd home for many thousands of migrating birds in the autumn and spring. The lake covers an area of one square kilometer, interspersed with islands that serve as protected bird nesting sites. It has become a major stopover for migrating birds flying from Europe to Africa and back, and also a major birdwatching site. In 2011, Israeli ornithologists confirmed that Lake Hula is the stopover point for tens of thousands of cranes migrating from Finland to Ethiopia every winter. In Israel, farmers set out food for them to keep them from damaging crops near the lake. This likely has contributed to increased density.A 2.51-minute video clip presenting the event in the Agamon is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0QrhaM6X6I (Israel TV, Channel 11 News, 19 Dec 2021; presenter/commentator, Ruby Hammerschlag; in Hebrew). At the beginning, neurological clinical signs in an affected crane are presented. For a picture showing supernatant dead cranes in the Agamon (Hula Lake), see <tinyurl.com/3k24khww>. - Mod.AS][The affected birds are very likely common cranes (_Grus grus_). This species breeds in the northern parts of Europe and across the Palearctic to Siberia. In the boreal spring, these cranes embark on a long migration southward. Most eastern common cranes winter in the river valleys of Sudan, Ethiopia, Tunisia, and Eritrea with smaller numbers in Turkey, northern Israel, Iraq, and parts of Iran. - Mod.PMBProMED map:Hazafon, Israel: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700388,1759] See Also

They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings; - When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and - Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the latest reports on 4 human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 from China.To date (15 Dec 2021), since 2014, 57 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported in mainland China, the latest reported cases being the 25-28th cases in 2021.According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBAProMED maps:Guangxi Autonomous Region, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700294,355Hunan Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700294,341] See Also

The woman had exposure to deceased backyard poultry before the onset of symptoms. She developed symptoms on 17 Nov 2021, was admitted for treatment on 21 Nov 2021, and died on 23 Nov 2021.This is the 27th human case reported on Mainland China in the past year and the 52nd case reported since the 1st case was reported in 2014. Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks.Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flulike symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches), or severe respiratory illness (e.g., chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<mahmoud.s.orabi@gmail.com>******[2]Date: Wed 8 Dec 2021 23:15 ESTSource: Reuters [edited]https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-woman-dies-h5n6-strain-bird-flu-2021-12-09/A woman in China's Sichuan province died from the H5N6 strain of avian influenza last month [November 2021], a regional health bureau said this week, in the latest human fatality from the lethal disease.The 54-year-old woman from Zigong city developed symptoms on 17 Nov 2021 and was admitted to hospital on 21 Nov 2021.

Experts remind: In winter and spring, H5N6, H9N2 and other epidemic-prone seasons, citizens should continue to stay vigilant and take the following measures to prevent H5N6 and other bird flu.Wash your hands frequently: wash your hands after touching poultry, before eating, and after going to the toilet. To be cooked: poultry and eggs must be cooked before eating. Seek medical attention early: If you have respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, and general malaise, you should go to the nearest medical and health institution as soon as possible. If you have been in contact with poultry before, you should take the initiative to tell your doctor. Do not eat dead poultry meat. Do not buy poultry and bird products of unknown origin.

It is the 1st case in a commercial livestock farm.According to the Ministry of Agriculture, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected last Friday [27 Nov 2021] on a laying hen farm in the Nord department, just a few kilometres from the Belgian border. Investigations were currently underway to trace the route of infection.According to the ministry, the flock was culled and the farm immediately disinfected. A protection zone and a surveillance zone had been set up around the outbreak. This is connected with strict biosecurity regulations for poultry farmers and a transport ban for birds.The alliance of the Confederation Paysanne (Conf), an association of small farmers, and the Federation of Organic Farmers (FNAB), meanwhile, stressed that the farm in question was a commercial one with 160 000 birds and was also located in a region with close links to Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. The organisations had jointly lodged a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court in order to bring down the new disease protection requirements. Among other things, they see high hurdles for exemptions from the stall obligation endangering animal welfare and the existence of free-range farms.According to Conf and FNAB, there is scientific evidence that the risk of introducing avian influenza into free-range systems is generally low. The spread of the disease depends mainly on the density of the flock, and the transport of goods and animals and the introduction of people also play an important role in the spread of the virus. It is also criticised that exemptions from the obligation to keep animals in confined areas are only possible if a veterinarian has previously certified that the animals are suffering from the disease.In France, according to official data, 4 cases of avian influenza in wild birds and 3 cases in backyard flocks have been registered so far. Lac de Madine in the Grand-Est region [map at <tinyurl.com/2hsb33ah>] is currently experiencing high mortality in swans, according to the ministry. Of the population of more than 1000 individuals, about 1/5 have died, it said. The previous epidemic, which came to a halt only last spring, had been concentrated in the southwest of the country and affected 492 commercial livestock farms, according to the ministry. By official order, a total of about 3.5 million birds, mostly ducks, had been killed at the time [see comment].--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[The above outbreak was reported by France to the OIE on Fri 27 Nov 2021, following the confirmation of HPAI H5N1 in the commercial laying hen farm on 26 Nov 2021; see item [10] in 20211205.8700016. The immediate notification included the following information on the affected population: ""Increase in mortality in a laying hen farm (15 000 deaths out of 80 000). The farm is composed of 2 separate buildings (2 x 80 000 hens). Depopulation is in progress in the outbreak, and preliminary disinfection will be applied. An epidemiological investigation is being carried out. Movements of poultry and poultry products from farms keeping poultry in the protection and surveillance zones is prohibited. The origin of the infection is not known at this time.""The above media addresses the reservations of the farming industry, challenging the applied control and prevention measures. These measures are prescribed by EU legislation, based upon scientific opinion. Some of the measures have been recently reviewed; see Nielsen S S, Alvarez J, Bicout D J, et al. Scientific Opinion on the assessment of the control measures of the category A diseases of Animal Health Law: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. EFSA Journal. 2021; 19(1): 6372, 78 pp; https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2021.6372.The current epizootic, involving many European and other countries, is caused by HPAI H5N1. The earlier epizootic in France, mainly affecting the duck industry in the southwest, was caused by HPAI H5N8; see Guinat C, Artois J, Bronner A, et al.

According to the media report (https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/bulgaria-reports-bird-flu-outbreak-industrial-farm-2021-12-03/), Bulgarian veterinary authorities will cull more than 80 000 chickens in the southern village of Tsalapitsa after a bird flu outbreak was confirmed at an industrial farm there, the food safety agency said on Friday [3 Dec 2021]. The agency said it had also found the highly contagious disease at a backyard farm in the same village and at a backyard farm in the nearby village of Varvara and would cull about 100 chickens there. We believe the outbreaks detected in Tsalapitsa correspond to the outbreak identified in the OIE report as ID ob_93350 (laying hen commercial farm) and ID ob_93343 (backyard). This is because the village of Tsalapitsa (Plovdiv district) is part of Rodopi municipality. - Mod.CRD]******[14] Slovakia (Banskobystricky): wild bird, HPAI H5N1Date: Fri 3 Dec 2021Source: OIE-WAHIS (World Animal Health Information System) 2021 [abridged, edited]https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=43731Event started on 24 Nov 2021.

Sweden declared the risk as very high and raised its threat level to 2. In the United Kingdom, an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone was declared across Great Britain on 3 Nov 2021. To date, no human cases have been reported in the EU/EEA. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry and wild birds have recently been reported for the first time in Japan and South Korea. According to WHO, between January 2003 and 4 Nov 2021, 863 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus were reported globally, from 18 countries. Of these, 456 were fatal (CFR: 53%).

It was transferred to the wildlife hospital and died there.EpidemiologySource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species.Epidemiological comments: several outbreaks in poultry have occurred in Israel in the past few weeks. The hypothesis is that the domestic birds are infected by fomites sourced from wild birds. Israel is a migration route for about 500 million birds twice a year between Africa and Asia. The pond where the pelican was found is about 20 km [12.4 mi] from one of the outbreaks in poultry (Maayan Zvi).Control measures at event levelWild control measures to be applied: surveillance within containment and/or the protection zoneAdditional measures: zoning, disinfectionDiagnostic test resultsLaboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / ResultKimron Veterinary Institute, Avian Diseases Division (national laboratory) / birds / 1 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 1 Dec 2021 / positiveNorthern Poultry Health Laboratory (regional laboratory) / birds / 1 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / [12-13 Oct 2021] / positiveKimron Veterinary Institute, Avian Diseases Division (national laboratory) / birds / 1 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / [12-13 Oct 2021] / positive[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]--Communicated by:ProMED[The great white pelican (_Pelecanus onocrotalus_) is a huge bird that breeds from southeastern Europe through Asia and Africa, in swamps and shallow lakes. It is highly sociable and often forms large flocks. Wintering takes place in northeastern Africa through Iraq to north India, with a particularly large number of breeders from Asia wintering around Pakistan and Sri Lanka. - Mod.PMBThe location of the water pond where the sick pelican was collected is available at http://tinyurl.com/bdhb59pm. This is one of 2 water bodies, countrywide, that have become ""pelican-friendly reservoirs"" within a cooperative effort by Israel's Ministry of Agriculture (fisheries division), the Fish Farmers' Organization, the National Parks & Nature Reserves, and respective regional municipalities, to minimise the friction between man and pelican. Until 2012, serious economic losses caused by the pelicans to fish farms compelled farmers to take drastic measures driving the birds away. Since 2013, the pelicans, mostly arriving in October and staying to early December, are provided in the 2 locations a substitute food source. Tonnes of second-rate fish that are destined to be thrown away/recycled because they are not commercial while the ponds are seasonally emptied, are purchased at the cost of labor and transportation and moved to the 2 reservoirs (the other one is in northern Israel). A byproduct is reducing hazard to air traffic by encouraging the birds to remain, before continuing their flight to Africa, at a single location (https://www.iaf.org.il/4374-38053-EN/IAF.aspx).Israel's ""when and where"" regarding the great white pelican is available at https://www.birds.org.il/en/species-page/95/species-trends.A recent feeding session of the pelicans, late October 2021, can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcnxFsfmC-c.The thousands of pelicans in the Mishmar Hasharon reservoir have become, during the current and previous seasons, a national public attraction. During their recent stay, terminating at this time (early December), no overt disease or excessive deaths have been reported. The detection of a single HPAI H5N1 sick, infected bird (date of its initial collection not available) underlines the need for an enhanced One Health approach, including animal and public health authorities, ornithologists, nature protection and water supply agencies, during the seasons ahead. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED map of HaMerkaz, Israel: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8700041,17787] See Also

All sick and dead wild birds found in nature, or in cases of an outbreak, a collection of representative samples was tested using the specific molecular methods for HPAIV H5 subtypes. Additionally, wild bird species in wetlands, several zoos, zoological gardens, or rehabilitation centers were tested for HPAIV. During the active surveillance plan, several individual and outbreak cases of HPAIV and orthoavulaviruses were identified. In general, more than 900 fecal materials, cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs, and/or tissue samples were collected from apparently healthy live birds representing several different species and families.

Temporary Control Zones of 3 km (4.8 miles) and 10 km (6.2 miles) have been put in force around an area centred on Castlemain Avenue. This is the first outbreak in the south west during the resurgence of the disease that began in October [2021].Bird flu has been confirmed in captive birds and commercial and non-commercial poultry in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Essex, Lancashire, North Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Cumbria, Cheshire and Norfolk. An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) was declared across the whole of the country on [3 Nov 2021] to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading. It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers in the UK to follow strict biosecurity measures.Keepers with more than 500 birds will need to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites, workers will need to change clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures and site vehicles will need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly to limit the risk of the disease spreading.Backyard owners with smaller numbers of poultry including chickens, ducks and geese must also take steps to limit the risk of the disease spreading to their animals.Avian influenza circulates naturally in wild birds and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe over the winter they can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said that avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds and the risk to the general public's health is very low.[byline: Lisa Young] --communicated by:ProMED <promed@promedmail.org>[The glossary of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code includes the following definitions:- ""case"" means ""an individual animal infected by a pathogenic agent, with or without clinical signs"";- ""outbreak"" means ""the occurrence of one or more cases in an epidemiological unit""; - ""epidemiological unit"" means a group of animals with the same likelihood of exposure to a pathogenic agent. In certain circumstances, the epidemiological unit may be a single animal""; and- ""animal"" means a mammal, reptile, bird or bee.The applied term ""case"" (and not ""outbreak""), in reference to the event reported from Pokesdown and in other HPAI H5N1 events, is in need of clarification. According to the updated (25 Nov 2021) avian influenza report published by UK's government agencies DEFRA & APH (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#cases-in-the-uk), the recent confirmed events are the following.A.

Wales, H5N1 cases of which pathogenicity has been confirmed:- near Chirk, Wrexham, Wales (backyard chickens and wild birds)5. Northern IrelandThere have been no cases of avian influenza confirmed in Northern Ireland during the 2021 to 2022 season.B. Wild birdsSince the 43rd week of 2021, increased numbers of the collected wild birds have tested positive for HPAI H5N1; details are available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1034245/ai-findings-2021.csv/preview.In view of the concerning spread of HPAI H5N1 across Great Britain, the chief veterinary officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have agreed to bring in new measures to help protect poultry and captive birds. The national housing measures, applicable to all birds, whether they are part of a commercial or backyard flock, will come into force across the UK from 00:01 on Mon 29 Nov 2021. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED map:Bournemouth, England, United Kingdom: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699877,8390] See Also

Officials say it does not pose a risk to the public, and there is no food safety concern for consumers. This is not the same virus causing the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in the Midwest in 2015.""Testing birds before they go to market is standard protocol for our poultry flocks in Minnesota because it verifies healthy birds are sent to market, and if disease is detected, we can hold the flock and work quickly with producers to address the disease,"" said state veterinarian Dr Beth Thompson. The board quarantined the flock on Mon 22 Nov [2021] and continues to monitor and test the flock as well as commercial poultry operations and individuals with backyard flocks within 10 km [6.2 mi] for signs of the disease.Avian influenza is not a food safety issue. The board is working with federal, state, and industry partners in its response.[byline: Mark]--communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[""Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and respiratory secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.""To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must first be cleaned from the environment.""When LPAI findings occur, APHIS and its state partners work to address them quickly and keep the disease from spreading to new flocks. Because LPAI does not typically kill poultry the way that HPAI does, there may be additional control options beyond depopulation. Federal and state officials will work with producers to determine what option(s) are available.""

Although most detections have been in wild birds, many have also been in poultry.The increase of detections in wild birds points to a period of high risk in countries having migratory flyways this season. Poultry producers, small and large alike, must therefore implement all the necessary biosecurity measures to protect their flocks from exposure and infection. - Mod.CRD] See Also

Most of the cases were children with mild disease.--communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission.Avian H9N2 influenza A viruses have caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5 year old child in Hong Kong in 2003.Furthermore, the number of human infections with A/H9N2 avian influenza viruses has been higher in 2021 than in earlier years (23 cases, including the case in the above report), which is a cause for concern and highlights the need for continuous monitoring and risk assessments of these viruses with pandemic potential. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map of Guizhou Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699804,335.] See Also

According to the ministry, the reported cases were at a turkey farm on Ein Tzurim in southern Israel, and on a duck farm at Kfar Baruch in the north. The ministry said ""it was decided to provide preventive treatment to those defined as contacts,"" and that its offices in the north were reaching out to schools and others who visited the petting zoo at Kfar Baruch. There have been no reported cases in Israel of H5N1 among humans [ever].The Health Ministry added that the bird farms were ""under the treatment"" of the Agriculture Ministry, without elaborating. The H5N1 subtype of avian flu can be deadly if transferred to humans. Israeli and Palestinian growers have dealt with sporadic outbreaks of the virus over the years, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled to stop the virus from spreading.In 2006, southern Israel's poultry industry was brought nearly to the brink of collapse, growers said, after a number of culls following the discovery of bird flu.--communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the submission above.The Ministry of Agriculture published on Sun 21 Nov 2021 the following press release (in Hebrew, translated): ""H5N1 avian influenza was detected in 2 foci. The first focus is a duck farm in Kfar Baruch, keeping 17 500 ducks, and a turkey farm in Kibbutz Ein Tzurim, which has 21 000 turkeys.""Upon receiving the laboratory test results confirming avian influenza, the veterinary services at the Ministry of Agriculture isolated the holding and started the application of the control measures.

The causative pathogen was identified on 10 Nov 2021 as HPAI H5N1 and notified to the OIE. ProMED published the notification (20211116.8699695). Mod CRD's commentary indicated that between 9 and 11 Nov 2021, 2 new outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 were identified in duck farms. One, located on a farm in Gyosan-ri, Naju, Jeollanam-do (South Jeolla Province); the other one located on a farm in Bondae ri, Eumseong, Chungcheongbuk-do (North Chungcheong Province). (OIE's follow-up No 1 is available at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=42594).S Korea's most recent (7th) confirmed HPAI outbreak is situated close to the first outbreak.Since 2004, when HPAI was reported for the 1st time in S Korea, 3 serotypes of the virus have been reported from the country, mainly during the winter seasons: H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8. The most devastating epizootic was caused during the winter season of 2016-2017, by the H5N6 subtype, co-circulating with H5N8; the latter caused fewer outbreaks.The current season's epizootic started earlier than last year's (2020).Some media sources have recently referred to recent H5N8 outbreaks in S Korea; we have, so far, not been able to get this confirmed. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED map:South Korea: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699828,195] See Also

An outbreak of bird flu has been confirmed at a poultry production facility in Himeji city in Hyogo province. It was reported that a large-scale disinfection work was started in the region due to the epidemic that emerged as a result of genetic tests after the death of an abnormal number of chickens suspiciously on the farm. The state administration set up a crisis desk to decide on the measures to be taken.The 1st bird flu outbreak of the year [2021] in Japan was confirmed at a chicken farm in Akita province last week [week of 8 Nov 2021], and 143 000 chickens were killed as a precaution. Then, a total of 49 500 animals perished due to the epidemic that spread to 2 different chicken farms in Kagoshima province. The detection of the highly contagious subtype H5N8 in Kagoshima Prefecture last year [2020], causing the country's largest outbreak of avian flu since the 2005-2006 season, raised concerns. With the latest development, the number of provinces with confirmed avian flu outbreaks in Japan this year has increased to three.The bird flu epidemic in Japan spread to many provinces across the country last year [2020], and it was announced that the number of killed poultry exceeded 6 million, breaking a record. Due to the spread of the epidemic throughout the country, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) also supported the culling efforts. It was recorded that the previous record belonged to the 2005-2006 season when a total of 5 078 000 chickens were killed due to a less contagious type of the virus.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[Japan's Hyogo prefecture is located in the Kansai region of Honshu, bordering Kyoto Prefecture to the east, Osaka Prefecture to the southeast, and Okayama Prefecture and Tottori Prefecture to the west. The new outbreak has already been subtyped as HPAI H5N1 (https://www3.nhk.or.jp/lnews/kobe/20211118/2020016081.html; in Japanese) and is located almost halfway between the earlier HPAI-affected prefectures: Akita (outbreak no 1 of the current AI season; subtyped H5N8), about 700 kilometers (about 440 miles) to the north of Hyogo, and Kagoshima, where outbreaks 2 (subtyped H5N1) and 3 are located, about 550 km (about 340 miles) to the south of Hyogo.

The samples were collected from dead birds by the LHSC and tested positive for influenza A virus by antigen-capture kits. On [13 Nov 2021], the LHSC conducted RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5. Subsequently stamping out on the affected farm was started. On [14 Nov 2021], stamping out was completed. Other control measures (including disinfection) in the affected farm are being implemented. On [15 Nov 2021], the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) conducted the sequencing test and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N1 and causative virus was determined as high pathogenicity avian influenza. This is the 2nd subtype of HPAI confirmed in domestic poultry in Japan in the 2021-2022 season after the H5N8 subtype was confirmed on [11 Nov 2021]. Movement and shipment restrictions are imposed on farms within a radius of 3 km [2 mi] and 3-10 km [2-6 mi] of the affected farm respectively.

This suggestion was supported by experience in China, where mass vaccination appeared to be more effective to minimize infections of AIV subtype H5 clade 7.2, which had no wild bird reservoir, than to minimize infections of clades 2.3.2 and 2.3.4, which did have wild bird reservoirs.""The said comment referred to a linked review paper: Liu S, Zhuang Q, Wang S, et al. Control of avian influenza in China: Strategies and lessons. Transbound Emerg Dis. 2020; 67: 1463-1471; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13515 (article 5.3, Vaccination effectiveness).Subsequently, ProMED received the following clarification from the Chair of OFFLU steering committee: a much appreciated, authoritative update. - Mods.AS/CRD]OFFLU would like to provide clarification regarding the moderators' comment about avian influenza vaccination: ""It has been argued that AIV transmission cycle cannot be fully blocked by mass vaccination if the viruses have a wild bird reservoir.""Vaccination against high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) has been deployed mainly in places where the virus is endemic in poultry, and where stamping out, movement controls, and biosecurity measures were not, and would never, be sufficient to allow virus elimination, largely because of the nature and structure of the poultry sector. Vaccination in this situation aids in reducing outbreaks and the extent of virus circulation and therefore reduces zoonotic infections in humans (as has been seen from 2005 in Viet Nam against H5N1 HPAI and from late 2017 in China with vaccines against H7N9 viruses). Endemic infection with H5Nx HPAI in these places will likely persist, regardless of whether virus is present in wild birds (although new strains will, on occasion, be introduced). Vaccination is being applied against Goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage H5Nx viruses in this manner, to selected poultry populations in multiple countries, including Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Russia, and Viet Nam. Unsanctioned vaccination has also been used in a number of other countries.The only place free from infection in poultry that uses vaccination as an additional preventive measure is Hong Kong SAR. Hong Kong SAR has a zero-tolerance approach to infection with HPAI viruses, in line with other places that do not have endemic infection. Vaccination against Goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage H5Nx viruses in Hong Kong SAR was first used in 2002 and was made mandatory for all chicken flocks in 2003 when it became evident that measures based on biosecurity alone were not sufficient to prevent infection in farms and live poultry markets.  It has been used continuously since then, with regular updates of vaccine antigens to match strains of virus circulating in the broader region (and addition of a vaccine antigen against H7N9). Despite the presence of virus in wild birds in Hong Kong SAR in most years, there has been only one single farm outbreak in vaccinated poultry in 2008, associated with an antigenic variant strain. Vaccination, once fully deployed, also prevented infections in live bird markets.  The vaccination programme is accompanied by a monitoring programme in farms and markets to ensure that so-called ""silent"" infection is not occurring and that vaccinated birds have developed an appropriate immune response.Vaccination increases the resistance to infection and reduces the likelihood of transmission in vaccinated flocks. Suitable monitoring systems to detect infection in vaccinated flocks are needed if the goal is to retain freedom from infection in domestic poultry. Under Article 10.4.1.6 in the current OIE Terrestrial Code, vaccination will not affect the high pathogenicity avian influenza status of a free country or zone if (appropriate) surveillance supports the absence of infection.Given the repeated cycles of wild bird introduction of Goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage H5Nx viruses, vaccination is being considered as an additional preventive measure by a number of countries, especially for higher risk poultry species and production systems. There are no reasons why it cannot be used successfully to prevent infection in poultry, even if present in wild birds, provided suitable vaccines are available, other appropriate biosecurity measures are applied (such as feeding strategies for birds reared outdoors that do not attract wild birds), and an appropriate, cost-effective surveillance system for all vaccinated flocks is in place.--Communicated by:Professor Ian H Brown, OBE, MIBiol PhDChair of OFFLU steering committee<secretariat@offlu.org>Head of Virology DepartmentDirector of OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease; OIE Reference Laboratory for Swine InfluenzaAnimal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) - WeybridgeUnited Kingdom<Ian.Brown@apha.gov.uk>[The moderators' commentary also addressed the need for improved national reporting on HPAI vaccines, indicating the following: ""According to OIE's WAHIS database, during 2019, vaccination against HPAI (subtype not specified) was applied in Egypt, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and Pakistan. Such information for 2020 has, so far, become available only from Egypt and Pakistan.

The main wild species involved are waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seem to pass easily between different bird species.""The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year.""Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.""Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure, and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans.""(https://www.oie.int/en/disease/avian-influenza/)A map of HPAI detection in Europe from 1 Oct 2021 to 15 Nov 2021 is available at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_EU/2021/Map_AI_EU_2021-11-15.jpg. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map of Europe: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699685,6010] See Also

The samples were collected from dead birds by the local veterinary service (Livestock Hygiene Service Centre; LHSC) and tested positive for influenza A virus by antigen-capture kits. On 10 Nov [2021], the LHSC conducted RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5. On 11 Nov [2021], the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) conducted the sequencing test and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N8, and causative virus was determined as high pathogenicity avian influenza. Stamping-out policy is applied to the affected farm. Destruction of all the susceptible birds in the affected farm is being implemented. Movement and shipment restrictions are imposed on the farms within a radius of 3 km [1.9 mi] and 3-10 km [1.9-6.2 mi] of the affected farm, respectively.Control measures at event levelDomestic control measures applied: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; traceability; quarantine; screening; stamping out; disinfection; movement control inside the country; ante- and post-mortem inspectionsWild control measures applied: screeningDiagnostic test resultsLaboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / ResultNational Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / birds / 1 / gene sequencing / 11 Nov 2021 / positiveLivestock Hygiene Service Centre (local laboratory) / birds / 1 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 10 Nov 2021 / positiveLivestock Hygiene Service Centre (local laboratory) / birds / 1 / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 10 Nov 2021 / positive[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[As reported in ProMED post 20211112.8699631, an additional HPAI H5 outbreak in poultry was recorded in Japan on 12 Nov 2021, affecting a farm in Izumi City, Kagoshima Prefecture. The distance between Akita (in the Tohoku region of Honshu Island, north Japan) and Kagoshima (on Japan's southern island of Kyushu) is about 1247 kilometers (775 miles). The event in Kagoshima is yet to be officially reported, including the results of a sequencing test identifying the subtype of the HPAI H5 strain reported there.Both events are suspected to have been caused by the introduction of an H5 virus by migrating birds; this deserves further epidemiological investigations. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED map of Akita Prefecture, Japan: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699682,3224] See Also

The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) was confirmed in a white-tailed sea eagle near Tarbert. The eagle was submitted to the Veterinary Laboratory in Limerick as part of the Department's wild bird avian influenza (AI) surveillance programme.The Department also confirmed that wild birds in Donegal and Offaly have also been confirmed positive for H5N1 today [11 Nov 2021], including both mute swans and whooper swans and wild geese. One Minister for State described the confirmations as ""very concerning.""Last week, a strain of the virus was detected in a peregrine falcon in County Galway. The Minister for Agriculture said it is ""very unfortunate that this case has been detected in such a rare bird.""However, [Minister for Agriculture] Charlie McConalogue commended the Department's wild bird AI surveillance programme. ""It is important that we remain vigilant, and I would also urge that flock owners should also be watchful. We should do everything that we can to ensure that potentially infected wild birds do not have contact with domestic flocks."" Members of the public have been urged not to handle any dead birds but to contact the Department of Agriculture or the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).Minister of State Malcolm Noonan added: ""There is the immediate issue of the direct impacts on birds generally, and also, of course, there may be issues arising that impact on birds of conservation concern, including those being re-introduced to the wild under projects such as the flagship White-Tailed Sea Eagle Re-Introduction Project.""The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has confirmed that although the H5N1 subtype can cause serious disease in poultry and other birds, no human infections with this virus have been reported worldwide and therefore consider the risk to humans to be very low. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.The Department added that the additional findings of H5N1 in wild birds highlights the risk of introduction of avian influenza to the poultry sector. It ""remains in close contact with industry stakeholders and reiterates that strict bio-security measures are necessary to prevent the introduction of avian influenza into poultry and captive bird flocks,"" a statement revealed.""Flock owners should remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Veterinary Office.""[Byline: Steve Neville]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5 was detected in 13 birds examined. In response to this, Kagoshima Prefecture has begun culling chickens at this poultry farm. In addition, the poultry farm has been designated as a ""restricted movement area"" that prohibits the movement of chickens and eggs within a radius of 3 km (1.86 mi), and a ""restricted export area"" that prohibits the shipment of chickens and eggs from that area within a radius of 10 km (6.2 mi). Within a 10 km radius of this poultry farm, there are 119 farms and about 5.53 million chickens and other animals are bred. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries informed that this is the 2nd outbreak of bird flu in poultry farms nationwide this season, following Akita Prefecture, which was confirmed as infected on 10 Nov 2021 (https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211113/k10013346441000.html; in Japanese).The distance between Kagoshima (on Japan's southern island of Kyushu) and Akita (in the Tōhoku region of Honshu Island, north Japan) is about 1247 kilometers (775 miles). The route(s) of introduction and the full identity of the H5 strain in each of the foci have yet to be established and published. Japan has suffered several epizootics of HPAI H5 strains, affecting poultry and wild birds, during the 2 recent decades. This included H5N2 (2005-2006), H5N1 (2007, 2010-2011), H5N6 (2016-2017) and H5N8 (2014-2015, 2020-2021). Several of the said episodes were attributed to be introduced by migratory birds and shared with seasonal HPAI outbreaks in South Korea, China and other eastern and south-eastern Asian countries. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED maps:Akita Prefecture, Japan: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699631,3224Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699631,6775] See Also

These have been confirmed as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) through molecular pathotyping with most viruses falling within HA clade 2.3.4.4b. A broad range of subtypes has been detected with domestic poultry in Africa affected by H5N1, Europe by H5N1 and H5N8, and in Asia by H5N1, H5N2, H5N6 and H5N8.H5Nx clades have evolved over recent years leading to subtype diversity, multiple genotypes and also antigenic variability. In 2016, a novel H5 clade 2.3.4.4b emerged and was responsible for waves of H5N8 infections in Europe, Asia and Africa in 2016 and 2017. These were caused by novel reassortant viruses containing internal gene segments from Eurasian low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and H5N8 viruses which were first found in China in 2013. Further reassortment with NA genes from Eurasian LPAI viruses gave rise to H5N5 and H5N6 subtypes. Until 2019, the northern hemisphere experienced reoccurring cycles of infection of predominantly H5N8 in wild birds with spillover events into poultry, with these viruses historically having a relatively stable genotype albeit with internal genes being subject not only to drift but also to reassortment.From mid-2020, H5N8 outbreaks occurred in Iraq, Russia and Kazakhstan caused by new H5 2.3.4.4b variants (""G2"") with closest relatives to 2.3.4.4b viruses detected in Israel and Iraq in 2019 and 2020, respectively. There are indications these are derived from reassortment with Eurasian and North African LPAI, however, under surveillance makes it difficult to understand the precise origins. These viruses made up most circulating viruses in wild birds and poultry throughout 2021, involving an unprecedented wide range of subtypes (H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6 and H5N8) and wide dispersal throughout Asia, Africa and Europe. This was further complicated by increased reassortment creating an epidemiologically and genetically complex landscape. Two genetically distinct clusters of viruses with changes in known antigenic sites circulated in Japan and South Korea from October 2020 and continued to be detected until spring 2021. They are closely related to separate outbreaks seen in European countries in early (""G1"") and late (""G2"") 2020, respectively.In Europe since September 2021 there has been an increase in H5N1 events. Sequence data from recent H5N1 events in September (Russia and the Czech Republic) and October (Italy and the UK) have a similar 2.3.4.4b HA to H5N5 and H5N1 strains found in Europe and Africa in late 2020/early 2021, linking further back to H5N8 circulating in Eurasia. Long branches to the diverse NP/PB1/PB2 segments would likely indicate under sampling or sequencing of wild bird-derived LPAI. Several phylogenetic groups in internal proteins linked by long branches indicate large diversity in wild birds.Such co-circulation of different H5 lineages in diverse bird populations lends itself to further virus evolution through both drift and reassortment creating an ever-evolving complexity in both virus genetics and spatiotemporal distribution. The constantly changing picture results in significant challenges. Whole genome sequence analyses are important for tracking such evolution and in assessing these emergent events. There are now genetically distinct 2.3.4.4b subclades circulating which are further diversifying, and it is difficult to understand their origins. Human infections with 2.3.4.4.b H5 viruses have also occurred in the past year and although we do not understand the precise origins of these outbreaks, the viruses appear genetically similar to strains circulating in wild birds and poultry. There is also an increased need for regular assessment of contemporary viruses against current vaccines used in poultry in different regions using genetic data and though antigenic characterization using standardized protocols and sera to understand the extent to which antigenic drift leads to reduced vaccine efficacy, by clade. Mitigation strategies based on enhanced farm biosecurity and modifications to production practices are needed when these viruses are carried by wild birds. Enhanced surveillance is needed for early warning and case detection as well as for vaccine antigen matching in places where vaccines are being used or under consideration.--Communicated by:Professor Ian H Brown, OBE, MIBiol PhDChair of OFFLU steering committeeHead of Virology Department<secretariat@offlu.org>Director of OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratoryfor Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease; OIE Reference Laboratory for Swine InfluenzaAnimal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) - WeybridgeAPHA Weybridge, Woodham Lane, New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey KT15 3NBUnited Kingdom<Ian.Brown@apha.gov.uk>[ProMED thanks Dr. Ian H. Brown, chair of the OFFLU steering committee, for this information and encourages our subscribers to read the complete statement found at the source URL above.""OFFLU is the OIE/FAO global network of expertise on animal influenza working to reduce the negative impacts of animal influenza viruses by promoting effective collaboration between animal health experts and the human health sector. Originally launched in April 2005 to support avian influenza, OFFLU was expanded in 2009 to include all animal influenza and to further support to Veterinary Services in their efforts to reduce risks to animals and the public from animal influenza viruses"" (https://www.oie.int/en/disease/avian-influenza/#ui-id-3).For more information related to OFFLU, visit its website at https://www.offlu.org/.The 1st HPAI H5N1 epizootic in Europe started in fall 2005, initially in Romania and Croatia, spreading across central Europe while causing high mortality in domestic poultry and wild birds. In 2010, when this event could be finally declared terminated, it had been detected in wild birds and poultry in 21 European countries. Its route of introduction could not be definitely established, though the role of migratory birds underlined.The 2nd avian influenza virus (AIV) epizootic in Europe, caused by an HPAI H5N8 subtype, became larger than the 1st one. Its ancestral strain was initially reported in China in 2010, spreading later to Japan and South Korea. In late 2014, it spread to Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, causing severe losses in turkeys and chickens, and -- in difference from HPAI H5N1 -- milder disease in Anseriformes poultry (e.g., ducks) and wild birds. It was agreed that the main mode of its spread was migrating birds. This is also the generally accepted view concerning the spread of the current H5N1 strain, prescribing the consequent preventive measures.Vaccination of poultry against ""fowl pest"" (the former term of HPAI), an OIE-notifiable animal disease with serious economic and trade-related consequences, was obviously considered a main preventive measure for decades. OIE's Terrestrial Manual, updated May 2021, says:""During the 1990s, the prophylactic use of inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines was employed in Mexico and Pakistan to control widespread outbreaks of HPAI and H5/H7 LPAI. During the 1999-2001 outbreak of H7 LPAI in Italy, an inactivated vaccine was used with the same (i.e., homologous) haemagglutinin subtype to the field virus, but with a different (i.e., heterologous) neuraminidase. This allowed the serological differentiation of non-infected vaccinated birds from vaccinated birds infected with the field virus and ultimately resulted in eradication of the field virus. Prophylactic use of H5 and H7 vaccines has been practiced in parts of Italy, aimed at preventing H5/H7 LPAI infections, and several countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East as an aid in controlling HPAI, in China (People's Rep. of) for H7N9, and in Mexico for H7N3 HPAI virus infections. HPAI viruses should not be used as the seed virus for production of vaccine.""(The manual mentions also ""Live recombinant virus-vectored vaccines"" with H5 influenza A virus haemagglutinin gene inserts, approved and used in a few countries since 1997; since 2015, non-replicating, haemagglutinin based H5 RNA particle, H5 expressed baculovirus and H5 DNA vaccines have been approved for poultry but have had limited use.)It has been argued that AIV transmission cycle cannot be fully blocked by mass vaccination if the viruses have a wild bird reservoir. This suggestion was supported by experience in China, where mass vaccination appeared to be more effective to minimize infections of AIV subtype H5 clade 7.2, which had no wild bird reservoir, than to minimize infections of clades 2.3.2 and 2.3.4, which did have wild bird reservoirs (https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13515).As indicated in OFFLU's statement above, ""there is an increased need for regular assessment of contemporary viruses against current vaccines used in poultry in different regions, to understand the extent to which antigenic drift leads to reduced vaccine efficacy."" However, availability of information about vaccination coverage and vaccine strains included is incomplete. All countries that have reported H5N1 since September 2021 referred to vaccination in their OIE notifications as ""not applied."" According to OIE's WAHIS database, during 2019, vaccination against HPAI (subtype not specified) was applied in Egypt, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico and Pakistan. Such information for 2020 has, so far, become available only from Egypt and Pakistan. Reporting should be enhanced, including updated official information from all OIE's member countries.To better assess the origin(s) of infection and to attempt forecasts, hopefully enabling timely application of precautionary measures, a One Health approach incorporating epidemiologists, ornithologists and virologists is essential. - Mods.AS/CRD] See Also

Britain last week [week of 1 Nov 2021] declared a nationwide Avian Influenza Prevention Zone, ordering farms and bird keepers to toughen biosecurity measures.[Byline: Sybille de La Hamaide; editing: Gus Trompiz, Toby Chopra]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] OIE notifications (3 events, summarized)[A] Masovia Province: poultry, HPAI H5N1Date: Mon 8 Nov 2021Source: OIE-WAHIS (World Animal Health Information System) 2021 [abridged, edited]https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=42213Mazowieckie [Masovia Province]: event started 1 Nov 2021.

Autumn migration from breeding sites to wintering sites is ongoing, and the low temperature of autumn and winter may facilitate the environmental survival of avian influenza virus potentially introduced to Europe. According to data available, the northern and eastern areas of Europe are likely to be the 1st places of new virus introduction. However, despite the increasing number of HPAI A(H5)-affected countries and outbreaks outside Europe, there is considerable uncertainty about the real geographical distribution of these viruses, particularly in wild birds and along the flyways.""During summer, HPAI A(H5) viruses were detected at lower levels than in winter and spring in resident wild bird populations in Europe, primarily in northern areas. HPAI outbreaks also occurred in poultry and captive birds in a few European countries. Despite this, the observed persistence of HPAI in wild birds in northern Europe into September 2021, in contrast with previous years, may indicate a risk for virus entry into poultry farms not only from wild birds migrating into Europe in the autumn and the winter but also from wild birds that are resident in Europe.""The occurrence of HPAI A(H5) virus incursions in commercial farms even where birds are kept indoors raises concern about the capacity of applied biosecurity measures in effectively preventing virus exposure. Biosecurity standards should be revised and reinforced, and their implementation regularly checked, primarily in poultry production systems at high risk of avian influenza.""The 2020-2021 epidemic with a total of 1298 outbreaks in poultry, 22.9 million birds affected, 85 detections in captive birds, and 2394 events in wild birds in 31 European countries appears to be one of the largest HPAI epidemics that has ever occurred in Europe.

Swans at the Diglis Basin in Worcester became sick, with this same strain of avian flu confirmed.Dead birds were collected from around the River Avon in Stratford town centre and sent to APHA's laboratory for testing, and the same strain of avian flu was confirmed.Christopher Kettle, Stratford District Council's community protection boss, said: ""The outbreak of avian flu in the wild bird population, including swans on the River Avon, is obviously of concern to residents.""The UKHSA has made it clear that the risk of the disease transferring from birds to humans is considered to be very low. ""To ensure this situation remains, the advice we have received is that members of the public should not touch or go near sick or dying birds and any dead birds found should be reported to the District Council on 01789 267 575 to assist with the disposal.""The UK food standards agencies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.""We are also looking to put up posters in the area to ask people not to feed the ducks or swans and remind people to keep to footpaths and to keep dogs on leads.""Following detection of bird flu in wild birds across the UK, the Chief Veterinary Officers from England, Scotland, and Wales have declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) across Great Britain to try to stop the disease from spreading amongst poultry and captive birds.In areas where the infection has been confirmed or is suspected, anyone who has been in contact with sick or dead birds or their droppings should make sure any footwear is properly cleaned and thoroughly wash their hands in soap and water.They should then notify the UK Health Security Agency's West Midlands Health Protection Team on 0344 225 3560 so that public health experts can determine if antiviral medication and active surveillance of their condition are necessary.[Byline: Paul Stuart]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[From 2014 onwards HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses dominated outbreaks in Europe, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8. The majority of HPAI H5 virus detections in wild and domestic birds within Europe coincide with a southwest/westward fall migration and large local waterbird aggregations during wintering. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of England, United Kingdom: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699545,4481] See Also

Additionally, the mixing of wild birds from different geographic origins during migration can increase the risk of virus spread and genetic reassortment resulting in changes in viral properties. At local level, as the AI viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, they can be easily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of infected animals as well as contaminated boots, vehicles, and equipment if the adequate biosecurity measures are not implemented.""(OIE avian influenza portal: https://www.oie.int/en/disease/avian-influenza/#ui-id-2)- Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map of Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699540,37287 and Jeollabuk-do, South Korea https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699540,37170] See Also

Public health advice is that the risk to human health from the avian influenza (H5N1) virus is very low.However, a UK-wide bird flu prevention zone has come into force meaning bird keepers need to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks. The move follows bird flu outbreaks in other parts of the UK. Temporary control zones have also been set up around the infected premises in Angus to limit the risk of the disease.Rural Affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon said: ""With the recent disease confirmations in wild and captive birds in the UK, it is not unexpected for avian influenza to be found in birds here. Temporary control zones have been put in place around the infected premises and we ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds.""Food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and that cooked poultry products including eggs are safe to eat.Scotland's chief veterinary officer, Sheila Voas, said: ""We are conducting further tests to establish the pathogenicity of avian influenza H5N1 in a flock of birds in the Angus constituency. ""We have already made clear that all bird keepers -- whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds -- must ensure that their biosecurity is up to scratch to protect their birds from disease. Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately.""--communicated by:ProMED <promed@promedmail.org>[The affected animals, in Angus, referred to in the BBC report as ""a flock of poultry"", have been referred to in other media sources as ""captive birds"". Specified, official information, including species, number and husbandry data, would be helpful.The locations of the HPAI H5N1 outbreaks which have involved poultry, captive, and wild birds across Europe during the period 1 Sep 2021 to 2 Nov 2021, are presented in Map 1, page 3 of DEFRA's updated assesment document, 'Ref: VITT/1200 HPAI in the UK and Europe', available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1030888/HPAI-assessment-UK-Europe-2-Nov-2021.pdf. The map includes an overlay indicating the migratory birds flyways. The affected countries in Northern Europe, located within the WestAsian flyway (lined black) are UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia.The DEFRA assesment includes additional information on the current H5 events in GB, as well as in northern and southern Europe, arriving at the following conclusions:""Given the detection of several cases of HPAIV H5N1 in wild birds in England, Wales and Scotland with the increasing number of poultry outbreaks in the Netherlands and in northern Germany, the risk of incursion of HPAI H5 in wild birds in GB has been raised from MEDIUM (event occurs regularly) to HIGH (event occurs often).""The risk of exposure of poultry to HPAI H5 in GB where biosecurity is sub-optimal has been raised from LOW (medium uncertainty) to MEDIUM (medium uncertainty).""The risk of exposure of poultry to HPAI H5 in GB where biosecurity is stringent remains at LOW but the uncertainty is to increase from low to medium uncertainty. This emphasises the importance of maintaining good biosecurity.""At this stage last year (30 Oct 2020) the wild bird risk was still medium and the poultry risk low. The wild bird risk was raised to HIGH and the poultry risk to MEDIUM on 4 Nov 2020, so events this year are about a week earlier than last year.""We are currently in a period of rapid seasonal change with respect to these risks and will continue to closely monitor the situation as more wild birds from northern Europe will be arriving over the few weeks"".Subscribers are referred to FAO's alert at https://listserv.fao.org/scripts/wa-fao.exe?A2=VPH-L;f33cc909.2111&S=, and to Mod.

Although most detections have been in wild birds, some have also been identified in poultry. HPAI H5N1 has been reported in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Israel, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Serbia, and Russia.The following information comes from a scientific report (Conclusion section, page 5) providing an avian influenza overview in the EU/EEA and UK published on 29 Sep 2021, which is available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/avian-influenza-overview-september-2021.pdf:""The presence of HPAI virus in western Russia and north of the Mongolian border with Russia, linked to key migration areas of wild waterbirds, is of concern due to the possible spread of the virus via wild birds migrating to the EU. Autumn migration from breeding sites to wintering sites is ongoing, and the low temperature of autumn and winter may facilitate the environmental survival of avian influenza virus potentially introduced to Europe. According to data available, the northern and eastern areas of Europe are likely to be the first places of new virus introduction. However, despite the increasing number of HPAI A(H5)-affected countries and outbreaks outside Europe, there is considerable uncertainty about the real geographical distribution of these viruses, particularly in wild birds and along the flyways.""During summer, HPAI A(H5) viruses were detected at lower levels than in winter and spring in resident wild bird populations in Europe, primarily in northern areas. HPAI outbreaks also occurred in poultry and captive birds in a few European countries. Despite this, the observed persistence of HPAI in wild birds in northern Europe into September 2021, in contrast with previous years, may indicate a risk for virus entry into poultry farms not only from wild birds migrating into Europe in the autumn and the winter, but also from wild birds that are resident in Europe.""The occurrence of HPAI A(H5) virus incursions in commercial farms even where birds are kept indoors raises concern about the capacity of applied biosecurity measures in effectively preventing virus exposure. Biosecurity standards should be revised and reinforced, and their implementation regularly checked, primarily in poultry production systems at high risk of avian influenza.""The 2020-2021 epidemic with a total of 1298 outbreaks in poultry, 22,9 million birds affected, 85 detections in captive birds, and 2,394 events in wild birds in 31 European countries appears to be one of the largest HPAI epidemics that has ever occurred in Europe. Note that the number of reported wild bird events is an underestimate of the total number of wild birds that have died from HPAI during this epidemic.""- Mod.CRD] See Also

Government scientists are currently conducting tests on the birds which died following an outbreak of avian flu in Stratford-upon-Avon.Tens of thousands of tourists visit the Warwickshire town and birthplace of playwright William Shakespeare each year to marvel at the scores of swans living on the River Avon. But in recent weeks, several of the swans - as well as ducks and geese - have been struck down with avian flu leaving wildlife experts fearing Stratford-upon-Avon's swan population could be wiped out.An outbreak was first confirmed at a rescue centre in Wychbold, a 40-minute drive from Stratford-upon-Avon, but now the town's rescue group says their swan population is at risk after several birds also contracted the deadly disease. Cyril Bennis, who runs Stratford-Upon-Avon Swan Rescue group and is a former mayor of the town, warned the current outbreak -- one of 2 currently active in the UK -- was 'beyond control'. Mr Bennis, 72, who has been caring for swans in the Worcestershire town for 40 years, said: 'Three weeks ago one of the sanctuaries that we take our swans to was shut down because of suspected avian flu. The swans that were on the mend there had to be put to sleep. The other rescue centre also had to be shut down because 2 swans there also had suspected avian flu.'Mr Bennis said that officials from the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) came and collected swans that had already died 2 weeks ago but that more animals were 'dying left, right and centre'. He added: 'I am having to pile them up in order to get some clarity on what I am supposed to do with them. 'At the moment, I have over a dozen dead birds -- not only swans but ducks and geese too. I have had to put 2 swans to sleep today, one last night, 7 others have died of suspected avian flu in the last few days -- it's a daily occurrence. I really fear that the entire population, which is more than 70 swans, could be seriously under threat. It is frustrating and heart-breaking to see any animal suffer in front of you. These animals are perfectly healthy one day and then dead the next. I watched one last night as died in my arms and I could not do anything about it.'Avian flu, more commonly known as bird flu, is not an airborne virus but spreads bird-to-bird through direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces, according to Defra. The virus can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing, and footwear. Cases can spike during the winter months if birds migrating from mainland Europe to the UK are carrying the disease. The virus can, in certain cases, also affect humans although Defra says the risk to the public is low.Defra is currently running tests to determine the strain confirmed in Stratford. Bird flu has also been confirmed at a premises in Wrexham in Wales.Meanwhile, the rescue centre where the disease was first confirmed has been closed while the outbreak is active. Wychbold Swan Rescue said it was 'devastated' by the outbreak and is currently the subject of a Defra control zone. The outbreak meant all birds at the site had to be culled while officers also put in place a 3 km [2 mi] and 10 km [6 mi] control zone measure around the premises.In a statement, Wychbold Swan Rescue told its supporters: 'As you can imagine, we are devastated by recent events. We can't believe this has happened again. This means until further notice, we are unable to attend to any birds. It's an extremely unfortunate situation that everyone at Swan Rescue is thoroughly broken-hearted about.'An outbreak late last year [2020] resulted in the death of around 25 swans in Stratford, as well as others in Worcester and Evesham.[byline: Katie Feehan]--communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[The HPAI epidemic of 2020-2021 is the largest that has occurred in Europe, with almost 4000 HPAI episodes reported in around 30 European countries. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swans, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of England, United Kingdom: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699427,16484.] See Also

The chief veterinary officer for Wales confirmed the presence of the H5N1 strain at a premises in Wrexham County on Monday evening (1 Nov 2021).Temporary disease control zones of 3 km [1.9 mi] and 10 km [6.2 mi] have been imposed around the premises to limit the risk of disease spread. A veterinary investigation is under way; however, dead wild birds found in the area have tested positive for the virus and are believed to be the source of infection.The Welsh government said the risk to public health from the virus was considered to be very low. This is the 1st confirmation of the disease in Wales since it was discovered in pheasants at a premises on Anglesey in January [2021].--communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[HPAI H5N1, a pathogen known for its zoonotic characteristics on top of its high pathogenicity in poultry, has been spreading in Eurasia and elsewhere since the start of the current autumn bird migration season; infected wild birds and outbreaks on poultry farms have been reported. This alarming development has led the Food and Agriculture Organzation of the United Nations (FAO) to distribute today (Tue 2 Nov 2021), through its <vph-l@listserv.fao.org> distribution list, an alert titled ""H5Nx highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) - increased detection likely along wild bird migratory pathways and risk for introduction (multiple regions).""The alert's introduction (references omitted) says: ""Based on events monitored over the past weeks, FAO expects increased activity of H5Nx subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in birds across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and potentially Africa during the autumn and winter of 2021-22. Strains of H5 HPAI virus are being detected in migratory birds in Western Europe, with most recent cases reported in Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The risk of disease introduction into other countries along wild bird migratory flyways is regarded as high. The Netherlands has already issued an order to keep poultry indoors following an outbreak of HPAI on a farm, and Italy has reported an outbreak in domestic turkeys. These reports are the latest in a sequence of detections in wild birds and poultry over the past weeks and months, starting with a notification in the south eastern Russian Federation mid-September [2021], followed by observed westwards movement of virus. Farms in countries that are situated along migratory flyways should put in place enhanced measures for prevention, early detection, and diagnosis of H5 HPAI, and for outbreak response. As other strains of avian influenza virus are also present in wild birds and poultry, co-circulation of multiple avian influenza strains provides opportunity for reassortment, potentially creating novel strains that could be more infectious or more virulent. The HA gene of the viruses from these recent outbreaks falls within H5 Clade 2.3.4.4b. Similar viruses have also been introduced into China via wild birds in late 2020. In this context it is noteworthy that a trend of increased human cases infected with clade 2.3.4.4b H5N6 viruses, associated with severe disease, has been reported from China. The zoonotic potential of avian influenza viruses should therefore be considered and appropriate personal protection measures applied when dealing with suspect cases in wild birds or outbreaks in poultry - or unexplained mortality in either.""In its further text, the FAO alert specifies in more detail the countries in which strains of H5Nx HPAI virus have been detected in migratory birds, including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Serbia, Sweden, and the UK, with the most recent cases reported on 16 Oct 2021 in Denmark, affecting a teal (_Anas_ sp.), in Germany, affecting a Eurasian wigeon (_Anas penelope_), and on 26 Oct 2021, at a wild bird rescue centre in the UK.Notably, a fox has recently been found infected by HPAI H5N1 in the Netherlands, and 2 commercial poultry enterprises were reported as infected by HPAI H5N1 in Israel, along the southward flyway.The FAO reminds countries about the importance to share full genome sequences and virus isolates with the scientific community early for further analysis and research so that epidemiological links between outbreaks can be established, virus evolution monitored, and zoonotic potential of emerging viruses assessed. This information is also used to match the appropriate vaccines to currently circulating strains, and novel viruses. There is a possibility that antigens in existing inactivated vaccines, used in several countries to protect poultry, may not be well matched to these novel, currently circulating strains. This is under review by FAO/OIE reference laboratories.It is anticipated that the alert, which includes FAO's advice to countries at risk, will soon be available on the internet. - Mod.ASProMED thanks Mary Marshall for providing a link to FAO's alert: https://listserv.fao.org/scripts/wa-fao.exe?A2=VPH-L;f33cc909.2111&S=. - Mod.SHHealthMap/ProMED map of Wales, United Kingdom: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699420,281.] See Also

Regarding terrestrial carnivores, red foxes have been shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1, and there was recent documentation of a spill-over of HPAI H5N8 to wild carnivores. Virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of Netherlands: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699389,104.] See Also

The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that it concerns a farm with 2 houses, one with approximately 24 000 birds, the other with approximately 12 000. In one house the hens showed signs of bird flu. Samples were tested and found positive for HPAI serotype H5 [for completed serotyping, see commentary].As a result of this outbreak and due to increasing finds of dead wild birds in northern parts of the Netherlands and of infected wild birds in Germany, the agriculture minister has implemented a nationwide housing order for commercially kept poultry as of 12 noon on [26 Oct 2021]. In this way, it wants to reduce the risk of the bird flu virus being introduced from wild birds to other farms in the Netherlands.To prevent the virus from spreading, the birds on the infected farm in Zeewolde are being culled by the authorities. Minister Schouten has also immediately announced transport restrictions for poultry farms in a zone of 10 kilometers [6 mi] around the affected farm in Zeewolde.This transport ban applies to poultry, eggs, poultry manure, and used litter, as well as other animals and animal products from commercial poultry farms. There are no other poultry farms within a radius of 1 kilometer [0.6 mi] around the infected farm. There are 6 other poultry farms in the area of 3 kilometers [1.9 mi] around the farm. These farms are sampled and examined for bird flu. There are 9 other poultry farms within the 10 kilometre [6.2 mi] zone which are affected by the transport restrictions.[Byline: Fabian Brockotter]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The event above was officially notified by the Dutch authorities to the OIE today (29 Oct 2021).According to the report, the outbreak involved 2350 cases among a total of 35 301 susceptible birds; 3 birds died. The remaining (35 298) birds have been killed and disposed of. The causative agent has been identified as HPAI H5N1 by the National Reference Laboratory at the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, Lelystad. The diagnosis was established by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (real-time multiplex PCR).The following ""Description of the affected population"" is included in the OIE report:""On 26 Oct 2021, an outbreak of H5N1 was confirmed on an organic layer poultry farm in Zeewolde. A 3 km [1.9 mi] protection zone and a 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone have been established. In the 3 km zone there are 6 other poultry premises. The poultry farms in the 3 km zone have been screened (examined, sampled, and tested) and there were no positive results. The subtype HPAI H5N1 is confirmed by the national reference laboratory. All susceptible animals on the infected premise have been killed.""The OIE report, including a map presenting the location of the event, is available at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=41785. Information about the genotyping of the strain is anticipated.Notably, a total of 863 confirmed human cases of HPAI H5N1 have been recorded in 18 countries (most of them in Asia) since 2003; 456 of the patients died.

From [16 Oct 2021], at least 11 young swans and 14 (out of 17) chickens had died. There were 33 young and adult swans with clinical signs, of which 6 of the adults had neurological signs. Official samples were collected at the official veterinary visit and submitted for testing to APHA Weybridge. On [25 Oct 2021], Avian Influenza M gene, H5 and N1 viral antigens were detected in all but one of the samples submitted, including tissue post mortem samples. No antibodies to AI were detected. The clinical picture continued to deteriorate with more bird deaths. As of [26 Oct 2021], all birds at the affected Wild Bird Rescue Centre have been culled and sampling taken for the epidemiological enquiry. Preliminary cleaning and disinfection completed on [27 Oct 2021]. A full epidemiological investigation is being carried out. Official zoning has been implemented around the affected site (comprising a 3 km [1.9 mi] Protection Zone and a 10 km [6.2 mi] Surveillance Zone), which have been temporarily implemented as a precautionary measure. This notification describes an event of HPAI in captive birds other than poultry. Therefore, and in accordance with Article 10.4.1 (4) of Chapter 10.4 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code: - This event does not affect the UK's HPAI freedom status; and -Trading partners should not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to this notification.Control measures at event levelWild control measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste.Diagnostic test resultsLaboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / ResultAnimal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge, United Kingdom OIE Reference Laboratory / Birds / 1 / Gene sequencing / 26 Oct 2021 / positiveAnimal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge, United Kingdom OIE Reference Laboratory / Birds / 1 / Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 25 Oct 2021 / positive[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[The following information comes from the Rapid Risk Assessment on HPAIV H5 in Germany on 26 Oct 2021, available at https://www.openagrar.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/openagrar_derivate_00042585/FLI-Risikoeinschaetzung_HPAIV_H5_2021-10-26_bf.pdf in German.Between October 2020 and April 2021, Germany and Europe in general experienced the most severe avian influenza epizootic to date. Despite a significant decrease in both cases and outbreaks during the spring of 2021, HPAIV H5 was detected in waterfowl and birds of prey over the summer, especially in the Nordic countries of Europe. In Germany, since mid-October 2021, there has been an increasing number of detections of HPAIV-infected wild birds in Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Bavaria as well as first occurrences in poultry and kept birds. The risk of HPAIV H5 spreading in wild birds and transmission to poultry and kept birds in Germany is classified as high. It is strongly recommended that biosecurity measures in poultry holdings be reviewed and, if necessary, strengthened.A map of HPAI detections in Germany during the period of 1 Oct 2020 to 28 Oct 2021 can be seen at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_D/2021/Map_AI_D_2021-10-28.jpgA map of HPAI detection in Europe during 1 Oct 2020 to 28 Oct 2021 is available at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_EU/2021/Map_AI_EU_2021-10-28.jpgRegarding the outbreak in UK, a press release published on 26 Oct 2021 (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/avian-influenza-bird-flu-identified-at-a-wildbird-rescue-centre-in-worcestershire) from Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Food Standards Agency, mentioned that: ""The UK Chief Veterinary Officer has confirmed a case of avian influenza (bird flu) at a wild bird rescue center in Worcestershire today.""Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry the disease and this can lead to cases in poultry and other captive birds.""All birds on site will be humanely culled. A 3 km [1.9 mi] and 10 km [6.2 mi] temporary control zone has also been put in place around the infected premises to limit the risk of the disease spreading.""UK Health Security Agency advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency has made clear that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers.

The patient is in critical condition.From 2014 to date [18 Oct 2021], 48 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel. --Contributed by:ProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka******[2]Date: Tue 26 Oct 2021Source: Reuters [edited]https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/rise-human-bird-flu-cases-china-shows-risk-fast-changing-variants-health-experts-2021-10-26/A jump in the number of people in China infected with bird flu this year [2021] is raising concern among experts, who say a previously circulating strain appears to have changed and may be more infectious to people.China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in 2021 to the World Health Organization (WHO), compared with only 5 last year [2020], it said.Though the numbers are much lower than the hundreds infected with H7N9 in 2017, the infections are serious, leaving many critically ill, and at least 6 dead.""The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern. It's a virus that causes high mortality,"" said Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam.Most of the cases had come into contact with poultry, and there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, said the WHO, which highlighted the rise in cases in a statement on [4 Oct 2021].It said further investigation was ""urgently"" required to understand the risk and the increase in spill over to people. Since then, a 60-year-old woman in Hunan province was admitted to hospital in a critical condition with H5N6 influenza on [13 Oct 2021], according to a Hong Kong government statement.While human H5N6 cases have been reported, no outbreaks of H5N6 have been reported in poultry in China since February 2020.China is the world's biggest poultry producer and top producer of ducks, which act as a reservoir for flu viruses.The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not be reached for comment on the rise in H5N6 human cases. However, a study published on its website last month [September 2021] said the ""increasing genetic diversity and geographical distribution of H5N6 pose a serious threat to the poultry industry and human health"".Avian influenza viruses constantly circulate in domestic and wild birds, but rarely infect people. However, the evolution of the viruses, which have increased as poultry populations grow, is a major concern because they could change into a virus that spreads easily between people and cause a pandemic.The largest number of H5N6 infections have been in southwestern Sichuan province, though cases have also been reported in neighbouring Chongqing and Guangxi, as well as Guangdong, Anhui and Hunan provinces.At least 10 were caused by viruses genetically very similar to the H5N8 virus that ravaged poultry farms across Europe last winter and also killed wild birds in China. That suggests the latest H5N6 infections in China may be a new variant.""It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (to people)...or there could be more of this virus in poultry at the moment and that's why more people are getting infected,"" said Kuiken.Four of the Sichuan cases raised poultry at home and had been in contact with dead birds, said a September [2021] report by China's CDC. Another had bought a duck from a live poultry market a week before developing symptoms.China vaccinates poultry against avian influenza but the vaccine used last year [2020] may only partially protect against emerging viruses, preventing large outbreaks but allowing the virus to keep circulating, said Filip Claes, Regional Laboratory Coordinator at the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the Food and Agriculture Organization.The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.Backyard farms in China are common and many people still prefer to buy live chickens at markets.Guilin city in Guangxi region, which had two human cases in August [2021], said last month [September 2021] it had suspended trading of live poultry in 13 urban markets and would abolish the trade within a year.[Byline: Dominique Patton]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Wed 27 Oct 2021Source: [in Chinese, machine trans., edited]https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2021-10-27/doc-iktzscyy2109486.shtmlMacau Health Bureau: A man in Yongzhou, Hunan has been infected with H5N6 avian influenza and is now in critical condition.According to the news from the Macau Special Administrative Region Government website on [27 Oct 2021], the Macau Health Bureau said that according to the latest notification from the mainland health department, Hunan Province has confirmed a case of human infection with H5N6 avian influenza. The Health Bureau urged residents to avoid contact with poultry and birds and pay attention to personal and food hygiene.According to the data, the patient is a 66-year-old male farmer living in Yongzhou City, Hunan Province. He developed symptoms on [25 Sep 2021] and was admitted to the hospital on [25 Sept 2021]. He is now in critical condition and had been in contact with poultry before he became ill.Since April 2014, there have been confirmed cases of H5N6 avian influenza in Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Jiangsu.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[To date, 46 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported in mainland China, the latest reported cases being the 21st and 22nd cases in 2021.The public may visit the following CHP pages for more information: the avian influenza page (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/24244.html), the weekly Avian Influenza Report (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/resources/29/332.html), global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza (https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf), the Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/CentreforHealthProtection), and the YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel). - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED maps:China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699277,155Hunan Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8699277,341] See Also

The epidemiological data presented in this report indicate that the virus is still circulating in domestic and wild bird populations in some European countries and that the epidemic is not over yet. During the summer months, HPAI A(H5) viruses were detected at lower levels than in winter and spring in resident wild bird populations, mainly in northern Europe. HPAI outbreaks also occurred in poultry and captive birds in a few EU countries. Based on these observations, it appears that the persistence of HPAI A(H5) in Europe continues to pose a risk of further virus incursions in domestic bird populations.""The HPAI detections in wild birds in the reporting period indicated that the virus is able to persist in wild birds breeding in the EU/EEA, even after a large number of wintering waterbirds (including barnacle geese, greylag geese, Eurasian wigeons, and mallards) have gone away. The persistence of HPAI in wild birds during the 2021 summer (opposite to what occurred in previous years, when HPAI disappeared in spring) suggests that the virus may be adapting to maintenance in wild birds. In coming months, many wild waterbirds, including young birds that hatched in 2021, will again arrive at their wintering areas in the EU/EEA.

Between 15 May and 15 Sep 2021, 162 HPAI virus detections were reported in 17 EU/EEA countries and the UK in poultry (51), in wild (91) and captive birds (20). The detections in poultry were mainly reported by Kosovo (20), Poland (17) and Albania (6). HPAI virus was detected during the summer months in resident wild bird populations mainly in northern Europe. The data presented in this report indicates that HPAI virus is still circulating in domestic and wild bird populations in some European countries and that the epidemic is not over yet. Based on these observations, it appears that the persistence of HPAI A(H5) in Europe continues to pose a risk of further virus incursions in domestic bird populations. Furthermore, during summer, HPAI viruses were detected in poultry and several wild bird species in areas in Russia that are linked to key migration areas of wild water birds; this is of concern due to the possible introduction and spread of novel virus strains via wild birds migrating to the EU countries during the autumn from the eastern breeding to the overwintering sites. 19 different virus genotypes have been identified so far in Europe and Central Asia since July 2020, confirming a high propensity for this virus to undergo reassortment events. Since the last report, 15 human infections due to A(H5N6) HPAI and 5 human cases due to A(H9N2) low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus have been reported from China. Some of these cases were caused by a virus with an HA gene closely related to the A(H5) viruses circulating in Europe. The viruses characterized to date retain a preference for avian type receptors; however, the reports of transmission events of A(H5) viruses to mammals and humans in Russia, as well as the recent A(H5N6) human cases in China may indicate a continuous risk of these viruses adapting to mammals. The risk of infection for the general population in the EU/EEA is assessed as very low, and for occupationally exposed people low, with large uncertainty due to the high diversity of circulating viruses in the bird populations"".---HPAI A(H5N8)-affected poultry establishments in Czechi:""On 17 and 18 May 2021, 2 HPAI A(H5N8) outbreaks were confirmed in poultry holdings in the Central Bohemian region. The outbreaks occurred both in backyard holdings. The affected holdings were keeping 43 and 198 birds from different species (chickens, domestic ducks, domestic geese, pigeons). Chicken deaths and clinical signs were observed in both the farms, but only in one holding there was mortality in ducks or geese. Pigeons were not affected. In total, 5 people were exposed to the cases. As both farms had outdoor access and birds, feed and water were not protected against contact with wild birds, indirect contact with wild birds was considered the most likely source of virus"".

Experts assessed that the case was a random one, and the risk of transmission of the virus is low at the current stage.According to the Health Commission of Guangdong Province, the diagnosed patient, surnamed [L], a 53-year-old male, is currently being treated at a designated hospital in Dongguan.Experts pointed out that the H5N6 avian influenza virus is highly pathogenic to fowls. Since it was first discovered in poultry in China in 2008, it has gradually replaced the H5N1 avian influenza as the main virus prevalent in China's poultry farms and live poultry markets.But in its natural state, the H5N6 avian influenza virus mainly infects birds, and infections in humans rarely occur. As of the end of March 2021, only 25 human infections have been reported worldwide, and all are dispersed cases.On 12 Apr [2021], the H5N6 avian flu was found in wild birds in Shenyang, a city in Northeast China's Liaoning Province, which marked the 1st confirmed cases of the flu in China this year [2021].After May 2014, H5N6 human infection cases have been reported in several places in China, including Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Jiangxi provinces, where at least 4 people have died.Experts from the Health Commission of Guangdong Province concluded that the emergence of the case was random and the risk of transmission of the virus is relatively low now. However, they warned that, although the H5N6 avian influenza virus rarely infects humans, it should be given high priority and remain under surveillance to avoid the spread of the epidemic by human factors.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the latest reports on a human case of avian influenza A/H5N6 from China.To date [27 Sep 2021], 44 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported in mainland China, the latest reported case being the 20th case in 2021.The last case from Guangdong was reported in August 2021 [See Avian influenza, human (16): China (Guangdong) H5N6 20210825.8611614].According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map of Guangdong Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8698701,334] See Also

Several dead harbour seals were collected in the 2nd half of August 2021 by the Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research (ITAW) of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany (TiHo). In samples of 2 animals, highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus (HPAIV) was detected by RT-qPCR at the Institute of Virology (TiHo) on 3 Sep 2021 and immediately reported to the local authorities. Subsequent examinations led to the detection of HPAIV of the subtype H5N8 in both animals with the highest viral genome loads in the brain. Morbillivirus-specific RNA, in contrast, was not detected. Post mortem and virological investigations of a third carcass, processed at the Veterinary Investigation Centre of the German Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein and the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), likewise revealed high viral loads of HPAIV, subtype H5N8, in the brain of the animal. No or very low viral loads of H5N8 were present in other tissues including the lung. Further intensified surveillance has been initiated and special precautionary advice applies to staff recovering and handling clinically affected and dead seals. Further work characterizing the seal viruses is ongoing at TiHo and FLI.--Paul Becher, Alexander Postel, Ursula Siebert, on behalf of the team at TiHo;Katharina Kramer, Hubert Wonnemann, Markus Weidner, Gabriela Wallner, on behalf of the Veterinary Investigation Centre Schleswig-Holstein and the responsible State Ministry;Timm Harder, Thomas C Mettenleiter, Martin Beer, on behalf of the team at FLI[Several subtypes of AI viruses (H7N7, H4N5, H4N6, H3N3, and H10N7) have caused epidemics in harbour seals, but they do not appear to become established in this carnivore species. HPAI H5N8 closely related to the virus circulating in poultry farms at the time was detected in 2 gray seals (__Halichoerus grypus_) stranded on the Baltic coast of Poland in 2016 and 2017. In November 2020, a harbor seal (_Phoca vitulina_) and a gray seal were found infected by HPAI H5N8 virus in the context of a seal mortality event in the UK. In seals and other wild mammals, HPAI H5N8 causes encephalitis and death. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8698675,68604] See Also

At the end of August [2021], a sick mallard hen and a dead mallard drake were found in the Lake Forest area during the avian botulism outbreak, officials say, along with a group of sick Canadian geese.The presence of avian botulism in the area is largely due to the drought, experts say. Outbreaks, according to the Wetland and Wildlife Care Center experts, develop as a result of one or more of the following conditions: flooding of dry land during warm weather, resulting in the drowning of terrestrial invertebrates that then provide a nutrient medium for the bacterium; receding water levels that expose mudflats, causing aquatic invertebrates to die which then provides a suitable nutrient medium; changes in water quality that result in the death of invertebrate fauna; decaying animal carcasses that provide maggots.Botulism toxin kills quickly, so waterfowl succumb within normal weight and no sign of weight loss. Because the birds don't eat while they are ill, bile stains the vent green (as does lead poisoning). Sick birds have difficulty holding their heads erect, so the term ""limber neck"" is often applied when the caustic agent is unknown, the center says.After the last outing, the survey team was able to rescue the sick hen, reaching her with the aid of a boat and some local residents. The geese are being monitored by residents, and once captured, they will be able to convalesce at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center.Many birds have lost their lives to this toxic disease, Debbie McGuire, executive director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center said. ""The hen was nearly drowned and at first residents weren't sure if she was even alive,"" McGuire said.According to the Wildlife Center's veterinarian, Dr Elizabeth Wood, there are 10 mallards and 2 Canada geese in intensive care.""The quicker these patients can arrive at WWCC, the better their chances for survival,"" Wood says. ""We expect this outbreak to be ongoing due to the drought and receding water levels throughout Orange County.""Thanks to the help of Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley, a hiccup in the plan was smoothed over, according to McGuire. The drones were able to fly over the research area to identify concentrations of birds in heavy vegetation.[Byline: Ashley Ludwig]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of California, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8697142,20759] See Also

She developed symptoms on 8 Sep 2021 and was admitted for treatment on the following day [9 Sep 2021]. The patient is in serious condition.From 2014 to date [17 Sep 2021], 43 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported in mainland China, with 4 out of 10 cases reported in just the past year.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[To date, 43 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported in mainland China, the latest reported case being the 19th case in 2021.The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/24244.html), the weekly Avian Influenza Report (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/resources/29/332.html), global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza (https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf), the Facebook page <(https://www.facebook.com/CentreforHealthProtection>), and the YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel). - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map:Hunan Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8685382,341] See Also

Human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus, Cambodia, February 2021. Emerg Infec Dis. 2021; 27(10); doi: 10.3201/eid2710.211039.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract---------In February 2021, routine sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness in Cambodia detected a human avian influenza A(H9N2) virus infection. Investigations identified no recent H9N2 virus infections in 43 close contacts. One chicken sample from the infected child's house was positive for H9N2 virus and genetically similar to the human virus.--Communicated by:Jurre SiegersInstitute Pasteur du Cambodge<jsiegers@pasteur-kh.org>[ProMED thanks Jurre Siegers for sharing the early release publication on human infection with avian influenza A/H9N2 virus in Cambodia.The reported case is a 3-year-old boy with a history of exposure to domestic poultry who presented with influenza-like illness in February 2021 and was confirmed to be infected with influenza A/H9N2 virus.H9N2 viruses circulate endemically in poultry from Cambodia, as they do in Bangladesh, Viet Nam, and China. Of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) detected in chickens in Cambodia in live bird markets (LBMs), 75% are H9N2. Whereas serosurveys indicate persons in Cambodia with poultry contact are exposed to H9N2, active human infections have not been detected.The authors conclude that ""endemic H9N2 and other AIVs in poultry remain a concern for zoonotic infection. An interdisciplinary One Health approach is warranted to curb continuing expansion and emergence. Early detection and control in animal populations, enhanced biosafety, candidate vaccines, and prompt antiviral treatment might mitigate the risks of reassortment and continued evolution that could result in H9N2 viruses with increased mammalian adaptation or human-to-human transmission potential."" - Mod.UBAThe 1st known infection by influenza A(H9N2) occurred in 1966 among turkeys in Wisconsin. This virus is currently regarded as the most widespread avian influenza virus subtype in poultry worldwide. According to OIE's criteria, spelled out in the International Manual, H9N2 is an LPAI virus (low pathogenicity avian influenza - in poultry). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is notifiable to the OIE, defined as ""an infection of poultry by any influenza A virus that has been determined as high pathogenicity in accordance with the Terrestrial Manual."" All naturally occurring HPAI strains isolated to date have been either of the H5 or H7 subtype.LPAI H9N2 is, thus, not OIE-notifiable.In addition to poultry, this virus has also been identified in wild birds, domestic mammals, and, occasionally, in humans.LPAI H9N2 causes considerable losses to the poultry industry. Since the early 1990s, vaccination against this virus has been used extensively in Asia and the Middle East using billions of inactivated vaccine doses. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED map of Siem Reap [Siemreab] Province, Cambodia: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8668826,3128] See Also

Genetic Characterization of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N8) Virus in Pakistani Live Bird Markets Reveals Rapid Diversification of Clade 2.3.4.4b Viruses. Viruses. 2021; 13(8): 1633; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081633.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract-------""The highly pathogenic (HPAI) avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have undergone reassortment with multiple non-N1-subtype neuraminidase genes since 2008, leading to the emergence of H5Nx viruses. H5Nx viruses established themselves quickly in birds and disseminated from China to Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North America. Multiple genetic clades have successively evolved through frequent mutations and reassortment, posing a continuous threat to domestic poultry and causing substantial economic losses. Live bird markets are recognized as major sources of avian-to-human infection and for the emergence of zoonotic influenza. In Pakistan, the A(H5N1) virus was first reported in domestic birds in 2007; however, avian influenza surveillance is limited, and there is a lack of knowledge on the evolution and transmission of the A(H5) virus in the country. We collected oropharyngeal swabs from domestic poultry and environmental samples from 6 different live bird markets during 2018-2019. We detected and sequenced HPAI A(H5N8) viruses from 2 chickens, one quail and one environmental sample in 2 markets. Temporal phylogenetics indicated that all novel HPAI A(H5N8) viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b, with all 8 genes of Pakistan A(H5N8) viruses most closely related to 2017 Saudi Arabia A(H5N8) viruses, which were likely introduced via cross-border transmission from neighboring regions approximately 3 months prior to virus detection into domestic poultry. Our data further revealed that clade 2.3.4.4b viruses underwent rapid lineage expansion in 2017 and acquired significant amino acid mutations, including mutations associated with increased haemagglutinin affinity to human alpha-2,6 receptors, prior to the 1st human A(H5N8) infection in Russian poultry workers in 2020. These results highlight the need for systematic avian influenza surveillance in live bird markets in Pakistan to monitor for potential A(H5Nx) variants that may arise from poultry populations."" - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map of Vehari, Punjab, Pakistan: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8663587,58698] See Also

""The health situation regarding highly pathogenic avian influenza is worrying. Since 1 Aug 2021, 25 cases have been detected in Europe among wild and captive birds,"" it said.Two cases of H5N8 were reported last week in Belgium -- one at a bird merchant and one at a private home -- and another at a home in Luxembourg that has been linked to the merchant in Belgium, the French ministry added. The latest cases involving the H5N8 strain of bird flu had prompted France to increase its risk assessment to ""moderate"" from ""negligible,"" which would lead to poultry being confined indoors in some areas, it said.The outbreak in France would not compromise the bird flu-free status the country had just obtained again after a previous wave of H5N8 bird flu, the ministry added. Bird flu outbreaks can prompt importing countries, notably in Asia, to impose trade restrictions on poultry products.France culled around 3 million birds last winter in its southwestern duck-breeding region as it grappled with the spread of the virus from wild birds to poultry flocks. The massive outbreak led the government to agree to new biosecurity measures with the poultry sector. These included a requirement to confine flocks during risk periods and a commitment to reduce the density of flocks in the southwest, home to the country's duck-based foie gras pate industry.[Byline: Gus Trompiz and Sudip Kar-Gupta]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[The 2020-2021 HPAI H5N8 epizootic observed in many European countries appears to have been one of the largest HPAI epizootics in Europe.

An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5-year-old child in Hong Kong in 2003.Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission.Furthermore, the number of human infections with A/H9N2 avian influenza viruses has been higher in 2021 (15 cases, which includes the new case from Hunan, China, in the above report) compared with earlier years, which is a cause for concern and highlights the need for continuous monitoring and risk assessments of these viruses with pandemic potential. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map of Hunan Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8647141,341] See Also

Unlike most other avian influenza viruses, this virus has also infected mammals, including cats, pigs, and tigers, and has shown to be able to transmit to humans. However, the virus remains poorly adapted to humans, and transmission from birds to humans is a rare event. Since the 1st detection of zoonotic transmission of HPAI A(H5N1), limited clusters of human cases have occurred, but no sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed but showed. Zoonotic transmission to humans from infected birds occurs either directly or through environmental contamination. Hence, almost all human infections have been related to close contact with infected or sick birds or their faecal products in domestic settings, e.g., in 'wet markets' in Asia or in backyard farming. The circulation of HPAI A(H5N1) in bird populations in different regions of the world has contributed to the emergence of different virus clades."" - Mod.CRD(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/zoonotic-influenza/facts/factsheet-h5n1)HealthMap/ProMED map of Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8638782,424] See Also

The patient is a 52-year-old female who currently lives in Boluo County, Huizhou City. The patient is currently being actively treated in designated hospital in Huizhou.Experts believe that this is an occasional case and the risk of transmission of the virus is low at this stage. Experts remind that citizens should continue to be vigilant and take the following measures to prevent H5N6 and other avian influenza:- wash hands frequently: wash hands after touching poultry, before meals and after going to the toilet;- cook poultry and eggs before eating;- seek medical attention early: if you have respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, and general malaise, you should go to the nearest medical and health institution as soon as possible. If you have been in contact with poultry before, you should take the initiative to tell your doctor;- do not eat dead poultry meat, do not buy poultry or bird products of unknown origin, and avoid going to live poultry markets as much as possible.[Editor: Zhan Yuquan]--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sharing this report on a human case of avian influenza A/H5N6 in China. - Mod.UBA]******[2]Date: Fri 20 Aug 2021Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h5n6-avian-influenza-case-reported-in-guangdong-province-china-66190/The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Hong Kong Department of Health reported an additional human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in China. This is the 2nd case reported from the mainland in 2 days.The case is a 52-year-old woman living in Huizhou, Guangdong Province. From 2014 to date, 40 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by mainland health authorities and 16 of the cases have been reported since December 2020.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks.Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches), or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illnesses have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the 8 Aug 2021 WHO summary and assessment, from 23 Jun 2021 to 8 Aug 2021, 6 cases of influenza A(H5N6) virus infection were reported to WHO from China. Since 2014, mainland health authorities have notified a total of 37 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N6). There have been recent reports of additional cases from Sichuan Province, China in March, June, and July 2021, as well as in Laos in April 2021.""All 6 recent cases were sporadic infections due to exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets. No suspected cases were detected among close contacts of these cases at the time of reporting. The 61-year-old woman who had mild illness was detected through influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance."" (https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/influenza/human-animal-interface-risk-assessments/influenza_summary_ira_ha_interface_08_08_2021.pdf)Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing.According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map of Guangdong, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8611614,68522] See Also

Avian Influenza Viruses Detected in Birds in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review.

This systematic review describes the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and virus subtypes detected in domestic and wild birds for the past 2 decades (2000-2019). We collected data from 3 electronic databases, PubMed, SpringerLink electronic journals and African Journals Online, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. A total of 1656 articles were reviewed, from which 68 were selected. An overall prevalence of 3.0% AIV in birds was observed. The prevalence varied between regions and ranged from 1.1% to 7.1%. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test showed no significant difference in the prevalence of AIV across regions, X2(3) = 5.237, p = 0.1553 and seasons, T = 820, z = -1.244, p = 0.2136. Nineteen hemagglutinin/neuraminidase subtype combinations were detected during the reviewed period, with southern Africa recording more diverse AIV subtypes than other regions. The most detected subtype was H5N1, followed by H9N2, H5N2, H5N8, and H6N2. Whilst these predominant subtypes were mostly detected in domestic poultry, H1N6, H3N6, H4N6, H4N8, H9N1, and H11N9 were exclusively detected in wild birds. Meanwhile, H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8 were detected in both wild and domestic birds, suggesting circulation of these subtypes among wild and domestic birds. Our findings provide critical information on the eco-epidemiology of AIVs that can be used to improve surveillance strategies for the prevention and control of avian influenza in sub-Saharan Africa.""Conclusions""Our review of AIVs in sub-Saharan Africa has provided an insight into the ecology and epidemiological trends of AIVs in birds over a 20-year period (2000-2019). We found a considerable diversity of AIV subtypes in sub-Saharan Africa, with some subtypes being detected frequently in both wild and domestic birds. Furthermore, AIV was detected in wildfowl and domestic birds in both the wet and dry seasons, with viruses being detected in both Eurasian migratory and indigenous African wild birds. These results suggest a year-round perpetuation of AIVs in Afrotropical ecosystems, with seasonal variation. Continued surveillance, especially in wild birds, to better understand the eco-epidemiology of IAVs, along with improved biosecurity on poultry farms, enhanced extension services and engagement of various disciplines under a 'One Health' approach in tackling avian influenza could assist in mitigating the impact of AIV in sub-Saharan Africa."" - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map of Oueme Department, Benin: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8616558,52171] See Also

Nevertheless, in mid-November [2020], the virus was also detected in wild birds in Belgium, followed by several outbreaks in poultry and other domestic birds.""Similar outbreaks occurred in France, and some of the cases in Belgium occurred at smallholder farms, including one in July [2021] in Moerzeke, near Hamme in East Flanders. The last outbreak in a commercial poultry farm, however, was over 3 months ago, according to VILT.Since then, no additional outbreaks have been reported in the commercial sector, which prompted Belgium to issue a self-declaration of being bird flu free dating from 29 Apr 2021. That declaration has now been validated by the OIE and published on its website.Other countries to recently issue self-declarations of being free from bird flu include Denmark, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands.Elsewhere in Europe, however, cases of the virus are still being detected in wild birds.""This shows that the virus is still actively circulating in these populations,"" said Belgium's Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC). ""That is why vigilance is still required in Belgium and why it is still important to comply with the general biosecurity measures.""The federal and regional authorities are jointly monitoring the situation in order to detect any new incidents of the virus at an early stage.""Poultry farms are actively sampled,"" said the FASFC. ""Poultry farmers and veterinarians also keep a so-called 'passive surveillance,' in which they are vigilant for abnormal mortality or symptoms that could indicate contamination with the virus.""Now that Belgium has been granted bird-flu-free status, poultry trade with other countries can restart, according to FASFC.[Byline: Helen Lyons]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[According to Belgium's FASFC, between the end of November 2020 and mid-July 2021, 8 outbreaks caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 virus were detected.

This is the 1st reported case of human infection of influenza A(H5N1) virus in India.The patient was a boy under 18 years of age with a recently diagnosed underlying illness in June 2021. Shortly after immunosuppressive treatment was initiated at the hospital, he presented with fever, cough, upper respiratory symptoms, and breathing difficulty on 12 Jun [2021]. His condition progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and he was mechanically ventilated but died on 12 Jul [2021]. In the past year, the boy resided with a family member who owned a butchery in Haryana state. Based on initial investigations, there were no reports of poultry sickness or deaths from a nearby poultry farm in the village where he resided. The source of infection is unknown at this time, and none of his family members have shown similar symptoms thus far.On 7 and 11 Jul 2021 respiratory samples from the patient tested positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the All India Institute of Medical Science hospital for influenza A and influenza B viruses but negative for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. On 13 Jul [2021], the samples were sent to National Institute of Virology, a WHO reference laboratory for influenza, for subtyping. Samples were tested for seasonal viruses of influenza A and influenza B, as well as avian influenza subtypes H5, H7, H9, and H10 by RT-PCR. On 15 Jul [2021], the samples tested positive for influenza A(H5N1) and influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses. Whole-genome sequencing and virus isolation is ongoing.Public health response----------------------Local and national health authorities have taken the following monitoring, prevention, and control measures:- Conducting further epidemiological investigation on the origin of infection of the case, including a multidisciplinary rapid response team (comprising public health and animal health officials) supporting the state of Haryana;- Strengthened surveillance, including enhanced monitoring of febrile cases (house-to-house surveys for fever surveillance conducted by health-care workers) within a 10 km [6.2 mi] radius of the patient's residence;- Disinfected the patient's residence and the surrounding environment;- Directed all health institutions in the district to report any suspected cases of human infection with avian influenza;- Closely traced and managed contacts of the case, including health-care workers at the medical facility where the case was provided care;- Performed risk communication activities to heighten public awareness, including for personal protective measures;- Conducted animal surveillance by the animal husbandry department.WHO risk assessment-------------------Available information and initial field investigations suggest that no additional cases have been suspected, indicating a low likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5) viruses may be reported because these viruses have been occasionally detected in poultry populations in India. The risk assessment will be reviewed as necessary, should further epidemiological or virological information become available.India has reported outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry farms every year since it was first reported in a poultry farm in Maharashtra state in February 2006. In January and February 2021, Haryana state reported an outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N8) in Panchkula district, which severely affected poultry in the area. In that outbreak, samples collected from birds from 4 poultry farms tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N8).Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.WHO advice----------The detection of this case does not change current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza. The primary risk factor for human infection with avian influenza is direct or indirect exposure to infected poultry (live or dead) or wildlife, as well as contaminated environments such as live bird markets. Additional risk factors include slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings.As at all times, the public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry or bird faeces. Hand hygiene with frequent handwashing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is recommended.Good food safety practices such as keeping cooking environments clean, separating raw and cooked food, and cooking food thoroughly should also be followed. There is no evidence to suggest that influenza A(H5), A(H7N9), or other avian influenza viruses can be transmitted to humans through properly cooked poultry. There is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that people have been infected with avian influenza by consumption of eggs or egg products. However, eggs from areas with outbreaks in poultry should not be consumed raw or partially cooked (with runny yolk).Health-care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures should use airborne precautions. Standard contact and droplet precautions and appropriate personal protective equipment should be made available and used during epidemics.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health, as well as timely sharing of viruses to inform risk assessments.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza or variant viruses, a thorough epidemiologic investigation should be conducted (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) on the history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal human-to-human transmission of the novel virus. Additionally, clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations [IHR (2005)], and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report. WHO does not recommend any specific measures for travellers and advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this event based on the currently available information.--Submitted by ProMED Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[Additional resources/links are available via the source URL above.India is now the fourth country in the South Asian region that has reported a human case of avian influenza A/H5N1.

This pathogen is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (e.g. chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) are highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment.Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Also, providing it to wild bird populations is extremely challenging and often unfeasible. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin.Portions of this comment were extracted from https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/avian-botulism. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of Minnesota, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8604381,3703] See Also

City of Lowell officials said they contacted the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife and were informed that the deaths are likely being caused by avian botulism.""The National Park Service sent us a note saying that they had seen 8 ducks floating in the water,"" Marion Larson with Massachusetts Wildlife said. ""The disease is called avian botulism, and the cause is an abundance of the toxin being present in the soil."" Some sick birds are drowning, unable to hold their heads up while others can't breathe due to paralysis of their respiratory muscles. ""Ducks, geese, swans, although swans seem to have a little bit less risk, and that probably has to do with their feeding habits,"" Larson said.There were 200 bird deaths around Massachusetts and New England last year [2020], including an outbreak that hit the lagoon at the Boston Public Garden in the fall. The water there was drained, but along the Merrimack River, it is not an option.""We have been recommending that if there's any feeding activity, that it stop because you're congregating the birds together,"" Larson said. ""We all know that certain diseases can pass very easily when you have crowds.""Botulism in birds does not cause illness in humans, but people should not touch dead or ailing animals. ""This is probably affecting local populations in the area, but overall, waterfowl populations are thriving,"" Larson said. Lowell city officials urged the public not to feed ducks by the River Walk in order to prevent ducks from congregating which could lead to further spread of the disease.[byline: Katy Preen]--communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. This pathogen is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. Several types of toxin are produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (for example, chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment.Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin.Portions of this comment were extracted from https://library.dbca.wa.gov.au/static/Journals/082168/082168-34.pdf. - Mod.

A spokesperson for the Center for Health Protection said: ""All new influenza A, including H5N6, are statutory notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong.""If you go to the Mainland or other affected areas, please remember to avoid going to wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. When visiting relatives and friends, pay attention to whether there are free-range poultry. Do not buy live poultry or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid contact with poultry or birds or their droppings. When going to any place with live poultry, keep personal and hand hygiene at all times.After returning to Hong Kong from the affected area, if you develop symptoms, you should seek medical advice immediately and take the initiative to inform your doctor of the places you have been to so that [they] can diagnose and treat potential diseases as soon as possible. If you have ever seen any live poultry while traveling, you should inform your doctor because you may have been in contact with a contaminated environment. This will help diagnose a possible avian flu case and arrange the necessary investigation and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.Locally, the Center for Health Protection has formulated a series of monitoring and prevention and control measures, and will always remain vigilant, and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health departments to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene at all times, and pay attention to the following suggestions when handling poultry:- Avoid contact with poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;- When buying live chickens, do not touch the live chickens and chicken manure, and do not blow their tails. Wash the eggs stained with feces, use detergent to assist in washing, and immediately cook and eat. After touching chickens and eggs, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water;- Eggs should be cooked thoroughly until the yolk and egg whites are solidified. Do not eat raw eggs or sauces with raw eggs. Cook poultry thoroughly. If there is still pink gravy flowing out or the bone marrow is still bright red, re-cook the poultry until it is fully cooked;- Wash your hands frequently, especially before touching your mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, after going to the toilet, after touching public objects such as elevator handrails, elevator buttons or door handles, or when your hands are contaminated by respiratory secretions, such as coughing or after sneezing; and- Wear a mask if you have fever or respiratory symptoms, go to a hospital or clinic, or take care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.The public can refer to the thematic webpages of the Centre for Health Protection for more information: bird flu page, bird flu weekly report bird flu statistics around the world and affected areas, Facebook page and YouTube channel.--Communicated by:Mahmoud Orabi<ahstandards@gmail.com>******[2]Date: Fri 23 Jul 2021 08:59 HKTSource: HK News [in Chinese, machine trans., edited]https://bit.ly/3y3LHPTThe Health Protection Center announced that it is closely monitoring 3 new cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N6) in the Mainland, and all 3 patients live in Sichuan Province.

The 3 cases in the above report had histories of contact with live poultry and all are above 50 years of age. There have been recent reports of additional cases from Sichuan Province, China in March, June, and July 2021, as well as in Laos in April 2021.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as frequency of cases is increasing. - Mod.UBAThe 1st human infection with (A)H5N6 avian influenza virus was reported from central China in 2014; the patient died. Avian influenza virus subtype H5N6 was identified in samples from contact poultry. Though the clinical signs in the affected poultry were mild, the virus was laboratory confirmed as highly pathogenic (HPAI). This strain has since been identified in additional countries in SE Asia.

However, in this current immediate notification, the case in Volta has not yet been officially reported to the OIE.This press release also mentioned that: ""Through effective surveillance and disease control management the Veterinary Services Directorate has prevented the extension of the disease into Ghana until now. ""Cases of the Bird Flu disease were previously recorded in 2007, 2015, 2016, and 2018, with significant economic impact on affected poultry farmers. The zoonotic nature of the disease calls for public alert and vigilance to mitigate the possible impact on the poultry industry and public-health in general. ""Accordingly, the Ministry announces the following measures for immediate compliance: 1. A total ban on the importation of Poultry and Poultry products from neighboring countries where the prevalence of the disease has been confirmed. 2. A ban on the movement of Poultry and Poultry Products within and from the affected regions and districts to other parts of the country, and strict inspection and issuance of permits to cover the movement of all poultry and poultry products from unaffected parts of the country. 3. Intensification of public awareness and sensitization by Regional Coordinating Councils and District Assemblies, especially in the affected areas"".Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtypes H5, H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 are circulating in the Sub-Saharan Africa.

The Delhi government had then ordered the closure of the Ghazipur poultry market.More samples collected from the Delhi zoo had returned positive in February [2021]. According to the World Health Organisation, human cases of bird flu occur ""occasionally"" but when they do happen, the mortality rate is about 60%.[Byline: Gopi Adusumilli]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the above report, the 1st fatal case due to an avian influenza virus has been reported from India. The virus subtype involved in this incidence cannot be ascertained from the information provided in the article, though subtype H5N8 has been reported in bird outbreaks in 2021 in Delhi.Human infections with the A(H5N8) virus cannot be excluded, although the likelihood is low, based on the limited information obtained to date (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/assessment-of-risk-associated-with-influenza-a(h5n8)-virus). In February 2021, Russian authorities reported 7 poultry farm workers aged 29 to 60 years infected with the A(H5N8) strain of avian influenza virus, although they showed no symptoms. ""Based on available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low, and WHO recommendations have not changed as a result of the incident.""

At the time, H5N1 and (LPAI) [low pathogenic avian influenza] H7N9 were the biggest avian flu threats, with H10N8 and H9N2 (which is still very much with us) pulling up the rear. While H5N1 has declined markedly since 2015, and China's massive poultry vaccination program, which began in 2017 has -- at least temporarily -- subdued H7N9, we continue to see sporadic human infections with H5N6. Unlike the novel swine variants, and recent H10N3 and H5N8 human infections -- which have been mostly mild -- avian H5N6 tends to make humans severely ill, and death has been reported in nearly half of the 32 cases to date. Last month, Sichuan Province reported their 2nd human case -- and the 3rd reported by China since the first of the year [2021] -- which followed 4 cases reported in late 2020. Today's case (#33), announced today [14 Jul 2021] by Hong Kong's CHP, makes the 8th case reported in as many months. First the CHP's statement, then I'll return with a brief postscript.CHP closely monitors human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in SichuanThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (14 July) closely monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Sichuan Province, and again urges the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.The case involves a 55-year-old man living in Bazhong City in Sichuan Province. He developed symptoms on [Wed 30 Jun 2021] and was admitted to hospital for treatment on [Sun 4 Jul 2021]. The patient is in critical condition. The patient had contact with live domestic poultry before the onset of symptoms.From 2014 to date, 32 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Mainland [China] health authorities. ""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any places with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the WHO and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel.It is worth noting that following nearly 3 relatively quiet years from mid-2017 to early 2020, avian influenza activity in China -- and around the globe -- has been rising, with HPAI H5 viruses and LPAI H9N2 leading the way. China has reported 8 H5N6 human infections since November 2020, more than a dozen mild H9N2 infections, and at least 1 H10N3 infection. In addition, Laos has reported both a human H5N1 and a human H5N6 infection since last fall. In February of 2021, Russia reported the first confirmed human infections with avian H5N8 (see https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2021/02/russian-media-reports-7-human.html), and in May [2021] the CDC Added Zoonotic Avian A/H5N8 To Their IRAT List. Given the lack of influenza surveillance and reporting from many parts of the world, it is likely that additional cases go unreported. While we aren't anywhere near the levels of avian flu human infections we were seeing between 2003 and 2016, this recent uptick is worth our attention. Michael Coston@Fla_Medic--Communicated by:Mary Marshall <mjm2020@googlemail.com>******[2]Date: Wed 14 Jul 2021Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h5n6-avian-influenza-case-reported-in-sichuan-province-china-82197/Hong Kong health officials report monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Sichuan Province on the Mainland. The case involves a 55-year-old man living in Bazhong City in Sichuan Province. He developed symptoms on [Wed 30 Jun 2021] and was admitted to hospital for treatment on [Sun 4 Jul 2021]. The patient is in critical condition. The patient had contact with live domestic poultry before the onset of symptoms.This is the 32nd human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) reported by the Mainland health authorities since 2014.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentations of avian influenza in humans include eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[To date, a total of 32 laboratory-confirmed cases (excluding the case above) of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 19 deaths at the time of the IHR (International Health Regulations) report, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014 [https://bit.ly/3wMoHTO]According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. With the continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of the viruses. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map:Sichuan Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8519755,350] See Also

Both infected farms are more or less located in urban areas. The 1st one is in a house with no physical separation between the rearing building (nor foot baths) and the house yard. There are almost no biosecurity measures applied. The 2nd farm is much more isolated, with some biosecurity measures. In both cases, eggs are sold on the premises without any biosecurity measures for the management of the trays. Given the numerous failures in the application of biosecurity measures, the precise source of the infection could not be determined through the traceability survey, although these 2 farms have in common the fact that the customers are served on the premises and inside the farm's fence.Control measures at event levelDomestic control measures applied: stamping out; disinfection; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; official destruction of animal products; quarantine; movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceabilityDomestic control measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zoneDiagnostic test resultsLaboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / ResultExperimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZS), Venezie (OIE reference laboratory) / birds / 1 / gene sequencing / 22 Jun 2021 / positiveLaboratoire central veterinaire de Lome (national laboratory) / birds / 2 / rapid test / 25 Jun 2021 / positiveLaboratoire central veterinaire de Lome (national laboratory) / birds / 2 / multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR multiplex) / 25 Jun 2021 / positive[The location of the outbreaks can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[This immediate notification report complements the information already published on ProMED-mail posting 20210701.8488651.Officially reported HPAI outbreaks (H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 subtypes) in Sub-Saharan Africa, by onset date (1 Oct 2020-9 Jun 2021), can be seen at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/HPAI_Africa/situation_update.html. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map:Maritime, Togo: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8489408,55242] See Also

Whole genome sequencing analysis of canine H9N2 subtype influenza virus isolates from Guangxi and its pathogenicity experiments in mice.

The amino acid homology and evolutionary tree were analyzed in DNA-Star and MEGA 6.0 software, and pathogenicity was studied through mouse infection experiments. 8 gene segments of 13 H9N2 strains were derived from 5 different lineages, which belonged to the new genotype. The amino acid sequence identity was 99.0% with respect to A/equine/Guangxi/3/2011 isolated from Guangxi. 6 internal genes were closely related to the H7N9 strain from human influenza virus in 2013. The HA cleavage site of all strains was RSSR-(cleavage site)-GLF, thus indicating low virulence. The amino acid sites HA226, NA119, NP375, and PB2 showed some changes, among which HA226 was changed to leucine L, which binds human SAalpha2, 6-Gal. In BALB/c mice infected with H9N2 virus isolated from healthy dogs, the virus did not replicate in vivo, but the strains Ca/GX/8 and Ca/GX/10 from symptomatic dogs replicated in vivo and caused clear clinical symptoms but not death. The virulence of the virus was enhanced after passage in mice, a finding speculated to be caused by the changes in amino acids at positions PA623 and 611 of PB2. A total of 13 H9N2 subtype influenza virus strains obtained from dogs in Guangxi have avian origin, specifically bind human receptors, and have a complex genetic evolution relationship, thus posing a great threat to mammals and humans. Therefore, prevention and control measures must urgently be strengthened.--Communicated by:ProMED Rapporteur Dan Silver[Subscribers are referred to the (copied, edited) recent commentary by Mod.USB, in 20210508.8345139:""It's worth mentioning that influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.Avian H9N2 influenza A virus has caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5-year-old child in Hong Kong in 2003. The human H9N2 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/2108/03, is of purely avian origin and is closely related to some viruses circulating in poultry in the markets of Hong Kong. The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission. Since the mid-1990s, 2 lineages of H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established in domestic poultry in southern China, Duck/HK/Y280/97 (Y280-like) and Quail/HK/G1/97 (G1-like) viruses, which are predominantly found in chickens and quail, respectively. These viruses have been sporadically introduced into humans and cause a flu-like illness. In the meantime, H9N2 influenza Y280-like viruses were also isolated from domestic pigs in Hong Kong in 1998. These findings indicate that the interspecies transmission of H9N2 influenza virus from avian to mammalian hosts continues to occur and poses a persistent threat for humans.Furthermore, the number of human infections with A/H9N2 avian influenza viruses has been higher in 2021 (13 cases including the new case from China [covered in https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2021/05/hk-chpwho-wpro-report-another-h9n2-case.html] as of 8 May 2021 -- compared with earlier years, which is a cause for concern and highlights the need for continuous monitoring and risk assessments of these viruses with pandemic potential.""Further studies of the dog-derived A(H9N2) virus strain, while checking its pathogenicity rate in birds, are warranted.

HPAI appears to be playing an important role in the epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. Farmers must apply stringent biosecurity measures.

Up to now, about 320 birds have died and the disease mortality in affected farms has ranged from 48% up to 100%, with 100% in chicken and turkeys with lower rates in ducks and geese. The Veterinary Services have set up protection and surveillance zones around outbreak locations and have commenced culling operations.Notification of the Ministry of Agriculture:""The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development [MARD] is closely following the monitoring of the epidemiological situation in the bird population in our country. Following the announcement given by the World Organization for Animal Health, about the presence of the Avian Influenza virus in some countries of the region and beyond, by order of Minister Milva Ekonomi, a plan of protection measures was drafted.""First, the entry of birds into the territory of our country from countries that have confirmed the presence of the disease was banned. A National Crisis Center has been set up at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to direct and coordinate the action plan. After analyzing samples from suspicious cases in backyard birds, at the Institute of Food Safety and Veterinary (ISUV), the presence of Avian Influenza (Avian Influenza) type H5N8 was confirmed. The disease is present only in 3 outbreaks, located respectively in the Administrative Unit Fushe-Kruje, in the Administrative Unit Dajt and in the Administrative Unit Bujan.""The Veterinary Service carried out the elimination of affected and suspicious birds and took measures to prevent further spread of the disease. Subsequently, the Ministerial Order prohibits at the national level the trade of live birds in open spaces and in live animal markets.

She developed symptoms on 13 May [2021] and was admitted for treatment on 16 May [2021]. The patient is now in serious condition. From 2014 to date, 31 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities.""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets, or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.While local surveillance, prevention, and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food, and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals, or their droppings;- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter, and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels, or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/24244.html), the weekly Avian Influenza Report (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/resources/29/332.html), global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza (https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf), the Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/CentreforHealthProtection), and the YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel).--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 9 Jun 2021Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/news-scan-jun-09-2021China has reported another human H5N6 avian flu case, which involves a 49-year-old woman from Sichuan province, according to a statement yesterday [Tue 8 Jun 2021] from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP). Sichuan province is in the country's southwest.The patient's symptoms began on 13 May [2021], and she was hospitalized on 16 May [2021], where she is listed in serious condition. The report did not say how she was exposed to the virus.China and a few other countries have reported H5N6 outbreaks in poultry since 2014, but China and Laos are the only ones that have reported human cases, which can often be serious or fatal. The latest case would raise the global total to 33, all but one in China.--Communicated by:Mary Marshall<mjm2020@googlemail.com>[According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. With the continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.The 1st avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N6 strain was isolated in March 2014 from a domestic duck in Guangdong Province, China. Since then, the H5 subtype has gradually become the main cause of the sporadic AIV infections in poultry in southern China. To date, a total of 31 laboratory-confirmed cases (excluding the case above) of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 8 deaths at the time of the IHR (International Health Regulations) report, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20210528.pdf?sfvrsn=30d65594_137). The above reports do not mention the nature of exposure of the case with poultry or products thereof.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map:Sichuan Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8437106,350] See Also

abridged and edited) from the South African government, Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development published on 6 May 2021:""The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD) hereby announces another outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in a commercial chicken farm in Randfontein in Gauteng.""Preceding this outbreak, 4 outbreaks were detected on other commercial chicken properties. A total of 5 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks -- 4 in Gauteng and one outbreak in North West. All affected farms have been quarantined, with control measures being implemented.""Genetic evaluation has confirmed that the outbreak reported in commercial layers on [13 Apr 2021] in Gauteng [see ProMED 20210414.8307559] and the one on commercial broiler-breeders in the North West seem to have been caused by non-identical AI strains. These 2 outbreaks were, therefore, more likely to have been caused by separate introductions. It is essential for everyone across the country to remain on high alert.""It must be mentioned that no human infection, due to these circulating strains, had been reported in Europe and thus the zoonotic risk to people is very low, the consumer has no reason to be concerned.""- Mod.CRDIn April and May 2021, several outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in many poultry farms have been reported in South Africa. HPAI H5 outbreaks have been numerous and occurring in different parts of the country. Some had different strains, which means that they come from separate origins. One of these outbreaks was caused by HPAI H5N8, while all the others were caused by H5N1. This report describes wild bird species (geese, gulls, and wild birds kept in a zoo) that were found positive during those outbreaks. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of South Africa: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8441060,4335] See Also

One of them was reported by our scientists at the Vector Centre in February 2021; this is the H5N8 virus, which we have known of for a long time. The 2nd case, reported this week by our Chinese colleagues, is H10N3. A person contracted bird flu,"" Popova said on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF). The official said that the goal now is to ""learn lessons"" from the COVID-19 pandemic and get ready ""so that no infection is critically dangerous for us.""The World Health Organization's spokesperson told Sputnik on Tuesday [1 Jun 2021] that WHO is conducting a risk assessment of a human case of a strain of bird flu jointly with China, after China's National Health Commission confirmed the 1st human case of the H10N3 strain of bird flu.There have been no previously reported cases of human-to-human transmission of the H10N3 infection in the world, with the virus considered to be low pathogenic among birds. Experts believe the case marks ""accidental transmission of the virus from bird to human,"" adding that the risk of large-scale spread is extremely low.--communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[The 1st 7 human cases of avian influenza A/H5N8 were reported in February 2021 from poultry farm workers who participated in a response operation to contain an avian influenza A(H5N8) outbreak detected in a poultry farm in Astrakhan Oblast in the Russian Federation. The laboratory confirmation of the 7 specimens was performed by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR, WHO H5 Reference Laboratory). The ages of the 7 positive cases ranged between 29 to 60 years, and 5 were female [https://www.who.int/csr/don/26-feb-2021-influenza-a-russian-federation/en/].These cases with PCR-positive results were clinically asymptomatic. Infections with avian influenza viruses of the same clade (H5 clade 2.3.4.4) have been reported from China since 2014 in people with exposure to infected birds. The likelihood of human infections with influenza A(H5N8) viruses has been considered to be low.It is imperative that, with these new cases, the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of animal and seasonal human influenza should continue to be implemented. Respiratory transmission occurs mainly by droplets, disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes. Short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses may occur, particularly in crowded, enclosed spaces. Hand contamination, direct inoculation of virus, exposure to infected birds or virus-contaminated materials or environments are potential sources of infection.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific, high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, and litter, and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on how to protect themselves and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Thorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new influenza A subtype with the potential to cause a pandemic (please see case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR). Evidence of illness is not required.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection, a thorough epidemiological investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted, even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map:Russia: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8426576,98] See Also

It concerns highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu at a turkey farm in Weert.To prevent the virus from spreading, the turkey farm (13 000 animals) was culled by the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). In the 1 kilometer [0.6 mile] zone around the infected farm, there is one other poultry farm that was culled to prevent viral spread (66 000 animals).Bird flu was not found at 7 other poultry farms in the 3 km [2 mi] zone.In the 10 km [6 mi] zone, there are 128 other poultry farms. In this zone, a transport ban applies. This ban covers poultry, eggs, poultry manure, and used bedding, as well as other animals and certain products from commercial poultry companies. Part of this zone is in Belgium and measures of the Belgian authorities apply there.Overview of previous Dutch farms with bird flu since late Oct 2020.[The detailed table-form overview, addressing previous bird flu infections on commercial poultry farms in the Netherlands in 2020/2021, including a total of 11 outbreaks affecting chickens, ducks, or turkeys, found infected between 29 Oct 2020 and 22 Feb 2021, indicating type of farm, number of animals, and dates, is available at the source URL above].Measures--------All current national measures, such as the obligation to house commercially kept poultry, will remain in full force. As of this week, for keepers of laying hens, breeding animals, and broilers a stricter reporting obligation is in place. They must report the loss of animals to the NVWA sooner. This allows bird flu infections to come to light earlier and reduces the risk of spreading.In addition, zoos, petting zoos, and hobby bird owners are required to shield their poultry and waterfowl so that these animals do not come into contact with wild waterfowl and their droppings. This can be done, for example, by keeping the animals in an aviary or by placing them in a run. Furthermore, a ban has been imposed on the display of ornamental poultry and water birds.Wild birds----------In particular, in the north and west of the Netherlands, sick or dead wild birds are currently found that test positive for avian flu. These birds are sent and examined. The advice is not to pick up dead birds yourself, but to report this to the Dutch Wildlife Health Center or the NVWA. Every week the NVWA places an update on the website where dead wild birds are found that are infected with the virus. Or see the overview map by WBVR elsewhere on this page. [The map ""spread from April 2021"" is available at the source URL, presenting the locations of outbreaks in poultry farms (purple), wild birds (red), and hobby farms/petting zoos (blue)].--communicated byTijs Tobias, DVM, PhD, MSc, Dipl ECPHM<t.j.tobias@uu.nl>[ProMED is indebted to Dr Tobias, University of Utrecht, for bringing a reminder of the missed information to our attention.

Many different strains of bird flu are present in China and some sporadically infect people, usually those working with poultry. There is no indication that H10N3 can spread easily in humans.The man, a resident of the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized on [28 Apr 2021] and diagnosed with H10N3 on [28 May 2021], the health commission said. It did not give details on how the man was infected. His condition is now stable and he is ready to be discharged. Investigation of his close contacts found no other cases, the NHC said. No other cases of human infection with H10N3 have been reported globally, it added. H10N3 is low pathogenic, which means it causes relatively less severe disease in poultry and is unlikely to cause a large-scale outbreak, the NHC added.The World Health Organization (WHO), in a reply to Reuters in Geneva, said: ""The source of the patient's exposure to the H10N3 virus is not known at this time, and no other cases were found in emergency surveillance among the local population. At this time, there is no indication of human-to-human transmission. As long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is not surprising, which is a vivid reminder that the threat of an influenza pandemic is persistent.""The strain is ""not a very common virus"", said Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the regional office for Asia and the Pacific. Only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, mostly in wild birds or waterfowl in Asia and some limited parts of North America, and none had been detected in chickens so far, he added.Analysing the genetic data of the virus will be necessary to determine whether it resembles older viruses or if it is a novel mix of different viruses, Claes said. There have been no significant numbers of human infections with bird flu since the H7N9 strain killed around 300 people during 2016-2017.[byline: Hallie Gu, Dominique Patton]--communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Global Public Health Intelligence NetworkDate: Tue 1 Jun 2021Source: Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), Government of Hong Kong SAR report [edited]CHP notified of a human case of avian influenza A (H10N3) in mainland ChinaUnique ID: 1009593077---------------------------------------------------------------------SummaryInformation from the National Health Commission showed that this is the 1st case of human infection with avian influenza A(H10N3) in the world. The case involved a 41 year old male patient living in Zhenjiang City in Jiangsu Province who developed symptoms on [23 Apr 2021]. He was admitted to hospital for medical treatment on [28 Apr 2021] and is now in a stable condition. His relevant close contacts did not show any abnormalities during the medical surveillance period. Upon genetic analysis, the genes of the virus were determined to be of avian origin and the H10N3 virus is low pathogenic among poultry.--communicated by:The GPHIN TeamGlobal Public Health Intelligence NetworkEmergency Management BranchPublic Health Agency of Canada, Government of Canada<phac.gphin-rmisp.aspc@canada.ca>Reseau mondial d'information en sante publiqueDirection Generale de la gestion des urgencesAgence de la sante publique du Canada, Gouvernement du Canada<phac.gphin-rmisp.aspc@canada.ca>[The official press release from the Government of Hong Kong SAR is available at https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202106/01/P2021060100875.htm.""An avian influenza A/H10N3 virus was first isolated in Hong Kong in 1979, and in a live bird market in Thailand in 2011. However, pathogenicity in mammals due to H10N3 viruses remains largely unclear. H10 subtype influenza viruses have been isolated in various species of waterfowl across worldwide geographic areas for more than 50 years. The viruses remain avian receptor binding, however, some strains are highly pathogenic to chickens, even though they lack multiple basic amino acids at the hemagglutinin cleavage site. H10 viruses occasionally infect humans"" (https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34489).""Seven H10 avian influenza viruses (AIVs), H10N3 (n = 2), H10N7 (n = 1), and H10N8 (n = 4), were isolated from chickens in Zhejiang Province, Eastern China, during surveillance of AIVs in live poultry markets in 2016 and 2017. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Zhejiang H10 strains received gene segments from H10, H3, and H7 viruses from birds in East Asia"" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30302582/).""Little is known about the virus, which appears to be rare in birds, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and does not cause severe disease. Yet avian influenza viruses that have little impact on birds can be much more serious in people, such as the H7N9 strain that killed almost 300 people in China during the winter of 2016-2017. The WHO has said there had been only rare instances of person-to-person spread of the H7N9 virus.""The strain is 'not a very common virus,' and only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, according to Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the regional office for Asia and the Pacific"" (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-018-4019-z).The current risk of further infection with H10N3 can be expected to be low, with experts describing the single case as ""sporadic"". With growing surveillance of avian influenza in the human population, more infections with bird flu viruses are being picked up. As long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is hardly surprising, and continued surveillance in animals, as well as humans, is the only recourse to detect emerging novel strains quickly. - Mod.UBAAs the general term ""highly pathogenic avian influenza"" and the historical term ""fowl plague"" refer to infection with highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus, it is necessary to assess the pathogenicity of influenza A virus isolates for domestic poultry. Although all naturally occurring ""highly pathogenic avian influenza"" (HPAI) strains isolated to date have been of either the H5 or H7 subtype, most H5 or H7 isolates have been of low pathogenicity (LPAI). Such strains, in contrast with HPAI strains, do not require the application of severe control measures on poultry farms.The methods used for the determination of strain virulence for birds have evolved over recent years with a greater understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity, but still primarily involve the intravenous inoculation of a minimum of 8 susceptible 4- to 8-week-old chickens with infectious virus; strains are considered to be highly pathogenic if they cause more than 75% mortality within 10 days, or inoculation of 10 susceptible 6-week-old chickens resulting in an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of greater than 1.2. Although all the truly HPAI viruses isolated so far have been of H5 or H7 subtypes, at least 2 isolates, both of H10 subtype (H10N4 and H10N5), have been reported that would have fulfilled both the OIE and EU in vivo definitions for HPAI viruses (see Wood et al. [1] below), as they killed 7/10 and 8/10 chickens with IVPI values greater than 1.2 when the birds were inoculated intravenously. However, these viruses did not induce death or signs of disease when inoculated intranasally and did not have a haemagglutinin cleavage site sequence compatible with HPAI virus. The IVPI of the currently discussed H10N3 strain deserves to be defined and compared with the 2 mentioned H10 strains. The above is mainly based upon OIE's terrestrial manual (version adopted in May 2015).Reference1. Wood GW, Banks J, Strong I, et al.

Between (24 Feb and 14 May 2021), 1672 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections were reported in 24 EU/EEA countries and the UK in poultry (n=580), and in wild (n=1051) and captive birds (n=41). The majority of the detections in poultry were reported by Poland that accounted for 297 outbreaks occurring in a densely populated poultry area over a short period of time, followed by Germany with 168 outbreaks. Germany accounted for 603 detections in wild birds, followed by Denmark and Poland with 167 and 56 detections, respectively. A second peak of HPAI-associated wild bird mortality was observed from February to April 2021 in north west Europe. The observed longer persistence of HPAI in wild birds compared to previous years may result in a continuation of the risk for juveniles of wild birds and mammals, as well as for virus entry into poultry farms. Therefore, enhanced awareness among farmers to continue applying stringent biosecurity measures and to monitor and report increases in daily mortality and drops in production parameters, are recommended. As many as 16 different genotypes were identified to date in Europe and Russia, suggesting a high propensity of these viruses to reassort. The viruses characterized to date retain a preference for avian-type receptors; however, transmission events to mammals and the identification of sporadic mutations of mammal adaptation, indicate ongoing evolution processes and possible increased ability of viruses within this clade to further adapt and transmit to mammals including humans. Since the last report, 2 human infections due to A(H5N6) HPAI were reported from China and Laos and 10 human cases due to A(H9N2) low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus identified in China and Cambodia. The risk of infection for the general population in the EU/EEA is assessed as very low and for occupationally exposed people low. People exposed during avian influenza outbreaks should adhere to protection measures, strictly wear personal protective equipment and get tested immediately when developing respiratory symptoms or conjunctivitis within 10 days after exposure.""Reference1.

In Europe, at least 14 different reassortant viruses of different subtypes were determined. Viruses of the H5N8 subtype are dominant, as is the case in Germany: 3 different H5N8 reassortants, as well as viruses of the subtypes H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, and H5N5 have been genetically characterized. These viruses also show a distinct neurotropism with partially very high viral loads in the brain.""In Germany, 245 outbreaks have occurred so far in poultry, including captive birds in zoological facilities. Wherever there are potential contacts between wild birds and domestic poultry, especially waterfowl, infections can be introduced, and new sources of infection can emerge unless an escape of virus from affected flocks can be prevented. Virus-contaminated material (footwear, vehicles, objects, litter) is considered the most likely source of infection. Poultry farms that share and move litter or other materials or tools, or even batches of birds, between units are particularly at risk.""Between 21 Dec 2020 and 16 Jan 2021, a series of 18 HPAI H5 outbreaks occurred in turkeys (mostly fatteners) and one in ducks in the district of Cloppenburg, a region with high poultry density. The sources of infection are unknown. However, the full genome sequences of the viruses from the affected holdings are almost identical, so that secondary spread between the flocks can be assumed.""Another series of outbreaks relating to HPAIV H5N8 occurred since the end of February [2021] in the district of Cloppenburg that recorded 18 outbreaks, including 16 turkey fattening farms. Here, the full genome sequences of the analyzed viruses demonstrated genetically clearly distinguishable viruses compared to the viruses of the outbreaks in December [2020] and January [2021] in the same county. In this case, too, there are indications, based on the closely matching full-genome sequences, that there must have been spread between some flocks.""A series of secondary infections, affecting several federal states, was caused by the distribution of infected live poultry in mobile trade. Approximately 100 new outbreaks in poultry, mostly in small holdings, especially in Thuringia and Baden-Wurttemberg, were caused as described above in a short period between the end of March and the beginning of April [2021]. However, all outbreaks were controlled quickly and effectively, although it is of concern that potential disease spread due to mobile trade of poultry remains a threat.""A map of HPAI detections in Germany during the period 1 Oct 2020 to 6 May 2021 can be seen at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_D/2021/Map_AI_D_2021-05-06.jpg. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map of Lower Saxony, Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8350239,2856.] See Also

Also, Cambodia reported a case -- also in April -- involving a 3 year old boy.While most H9N2 infections are mild, their reported incidence has risen sharply in 2021. Whether this rise is more to do with better surveillance and reporting or is propelled by increased transmission of the virus to humans, is unknown.The following update comes from the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO):""Between 23 and 29 Apr 2021, there was one new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) reported from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to WHO in the Western Pacific Region. The case is a 30 year old female from Huizhou, Guangdong Province. The case had onset of mild symptoms on 20 Apr 2021.""To date, 12 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported from China in 2021, and a total of 54 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region since December 2015.""Admittedly, the numbers we have -- as elevated as they may be of late -- are believed to be significant undercounts. Most people in China (or elsewhere) who get minor-to-moderate flu-like symptoms never bother to see a doctor or get tested.Serological studies suggest human infection is far commoner than those numbers would have us believe (see report on high seroprevalence of avian influenza H9 among poultry professionals in Pakistan in J Infect Public Health: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2018.11.009).We've covered the growing risks from the avian H9N2 virus numerous times over the years, not only as a standalone virus (see Viruses: characterization of the H9N2 avian influenza viruses currently circulating in South China https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2019/11/viruses-characterization-of-h9n2-avian.html) but also for its ability to reassort with other -- potentially more dangerous -- influenza subtypes (see Viruses: PA from recent H9N2 AIV enhances H5N1 infection in mammalian systems https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/09/viruses-pa-from-recent-h9n2-aiv.html).In December 2019, in Emerging Infectious Diseases (Novel reassortant HPAI A(H5N2) Virus in broiler chickens, Egypt https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/1/19-0570_article), we saw a new proof of concept in the field, after an HPAI H5N8 virus reassorted with an LPAI H9N2 virus, and produced a new HPAI H5N2 virus in Egyptian poultry.And a year ago the CDC added a 2nd lineage of the H9N2 virus to their IRAT (Influenza Risk Assessment Tool) short list of novel flu viruses with pandemic potential -- H9N2: avian influenza A(H9N2) Y280 lineage [A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018] virus:""Low pathogenic avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry in many countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Since the late 1990s when the 1st human infections with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus were identified, detection of this virus has been reported infrequently in humans and in swine and other mammals. In 2018, there were 7 reported human infections, most with known exposure to poultry and with the majority involving viruses of the Y280 lineage.""Summary: A risk assessment of avian influenza A(H9N2) Y280 lineage A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018 virus was conducted in July 2019. The overall IRAT risk assessment score for this virus falls into the moderate risk category. The summary average risk score for the virus to achieve sustained human-to-human transmission was 6.2. The average risk score for the virus to significantly impact public health if it were to achieve sustained human-to-human transmission was 5.9, also in the moderate range. For a full report, see https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/IR-001Rev0D-CDC-IRAT-Virus-Report_H9N2_2019.pdf.""While perhaps not the biggest pandemic threat we face -- very much like the sporadic jumping of swine-variant viruses to humans (see Canada: Manitoba Public Health reports 2 unrelated novel swine variant infections [H1N1v & H1N2v] https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2021/04/canada-manitoba-public-health-reports-2.html) -- we need to take the species jumping of novel viruses seriously, as even a mild influenza pandemic (on top of COVID) right now would present considerable difficulties.[byline: Michael Coston]--communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[It's worth mentioning that influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.Avian H9N2 influenza A virus has caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5 year old child in Hong Kong in 2003. The human H9N2 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/2108/03, is of purely avian origin and is closely related to some viruses circulating in poultry in the markets of Hong Kong. The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission. Since the mid-1990s, 2 lineages of H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established in domestic poultry in southern China (a 3rd lineage described in above report), Duck/HK/Y280/97 (Y280-like) and Quail/HK/G1/97 (G1-like) viruses, which are predominantly found in chickens and quail, respectively. These viruses have been sporadically introduced into humans and cause a flu-like illness. In the meantime, H9N2 influenza Y280-like viruses were also isolated from domestic pigs in Hong Kong in 1998. These findings indicate that the interspecies transmission of H9N2 influenza virus from avian to mammalian hosts continues to occur and poses a persistent threat for humans.Furthermore, the number of human infections with A/H9N2 avian influenza viruses has been higher in 2021 (13 cases including the new case from China in the above report -- and it has been only 4 months so far) compared with earlier years, which is a cause for concern and highlights the need for continuous monitoring and risk assessments of these viruses with pandemic potential. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map of Guangdong Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8345139,334.] See Also

The case is a 3-year-old boy reported on 2 Apr 2021.In most human cases of H9N2 avian influenza, the associated disease symptoms have been mild, and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.The 1st case was in a 10-year-old boy from Sanming, Fujian Province. The child had onset on 28 Jan 2020 and was reported on 16 Apr 2021. The 2nd case is a 2-year-old female from Shiyan, Hubei Province, China with illness onset on 7 Feb 2021. Both cases had mild illness and have recovered. The case from Hubei Province had exposure to backyard poultry, while no history of exposure was reported for the case from Fujian Province. So far, no family clusters have been reported.To date, 12 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region in 2021, and a total of 53 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region since December 2015, primarily from China.It's worth mentioning that influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.Avian H9N2 influenza A virus has caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5-year-old child in Hong Kong in 2003. The human H9N2 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/2108/03, is of purely avian origin and is closely related to some viruses circulating in poultry in the markets of Hong Kong. The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission. Since the mid-1990s, 2 lineages of H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established in domestic poultry in southern China, Duck/HK/Y280/97 (Y280-like) and Quail/HK/G1/97 (G1-like) viruses, which are predominantly found in chickens and quail, respectively (2, 3). These viruses have been sporadically introduced into humans and cause a flu-like illness (4, 5, 7, 16, 21). In the meantime, H9N2 influenza Y280-like viruses were also isolated from domestic pigs in Hong Kong in 1998 (20). These findings indicate that the interspecies transmission of H9N2 influenza virus from avian to mammalian hosts continues to occur and poses a persistent threat for humans.*URLs:- http://outbreaknewstoday.com/china-reports-two-additional-human-h9n2-avian-influenza-cases-66110/- http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h9n2-avian-influenza-reported-in-cambodia-child-87607/- https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/news-scan-apr-21-2021- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11466825_Lack_of_Evidence_for_Human-to-Human_Transmission_of_Avian_Influenza_A_H9N2_Viruses_in_Hong_Kong_China_19991--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[The WHO weekly avian influenza update no. 788 dated 16 Apr 2021 notes: ""To date, 12 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region in 2021, and a total of 53 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region since December 2015"" (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20210416.pdf?sfvrsn=30d65594_120).""H9N2 avian influenza viruses have become globally widespread in poultry over the last 2 decades and represent a genuine threat both to the global poultry industry but also humans through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. H9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years.""Studies have reported how ""reassortants between H9N2 viruses and human seasonal influenza viruses are able to efficiently transmit between ferrets, and there is, therefore, a real danger eventually such a reassortant could emerge in the field.""""Several H9N2 viruses have human receptor binding, pH stable HA proteins that could potentially allow efficient transmission between humans, whilst other H9N2 viruses contain internal gene cassettes that allow extremely efficient replication in humans (i.e., genotype 57). Overall, there is a clear risk of both inter-subtypic H9N2/human influenza virus reassortant emergence as well as an intra-subtyptic human binding HA/efficient mammalian polymerase reassortant emergence, either of which could potentially pose a high zoonotic and pandemic threat"" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6669617/). - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED maps:Fujian Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8327505,332Hubei Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8327505,340] See Also

In addition, many European countries continue to report outbreaks of HPAIV subtype H5 in captive birds and wild birds. The risk of spread in waterfowl populations and disease introduction in poultry farms and bird populations (e.g., zoological institutions) is considered high. Currently, there is a high risk of introduction of HPAIV subtype H5 through virus spread between poultry farms (secondary outbreaks). Utmost caution is indicated in (mobile) trade with live poultry. Biosecurity measures in poultry holdings should be reviewed and optimized where possible.""Poultry and Captive birds in Germany:""In Germany, 133 outbreaks have occurred so far in poultry, including captive birds in zoological facilities. Wherever there are potential contacts between wild birds and domestic poultry, especially waterfowl, infections can be introduced, and new sources of infection can emerge unless an escape of virus from affected flocks can be prevented. Virus-contaminated material (footwear, vehicles, objects, litter) is considered the most likely source of infection. Poultry farms that share and move litter or other materials or tools, or even batches of birds, between units are particularly at risk.""Between [21 Dec 2020 and 16 Jan 2021], a series of 18 HPAI H5 outbreaks occurred in turkeys (mostly fatteners) and one in ducks in the district of Cloppenburg, a region with high poultry density. The sources of infection are unknown. However, the full genome sequences of the viruses from the affected holdings are almost identical, so that secondary spread between the flocks can be assumed.""Another series of outbreaks relating to HPAIV H5N8 occurred since the end of February [2021] in the district of Cloppenburg that recorded 18 outbreaks, including 16 turkey fattening farms. According to TSN reports, a total of 1.6 million birds have been affected since the beginning of the epidemic in 2020/2021; in Lower Saxony alone, the number of birds in affected farms has reached one million. Spread of infection is also possible across the federal states, and especially likely if poultry are traded. Currently, there are a number of HPAI outbreaks and suspicions of disease in poultry in Baden-Wurttemberg and Thuringia that could indicate such a spread.""Wild Birds:""Similar to the HPAIV H5N8 event in 2016/2017, increased mortality is now observed predominantly in waterfowl and bird species that also feed on carrion, e.g., various raptors, owls and gulls. The range of species affected is similar across Europe. Exceedingly high mortality rates were observed in barnacle geese, wigeons, and red knots in the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park in December 2020. The situation there has calmed down in the meantime. Deceased and infected birds of prey, gulls, and owls are indicators of a localized outbreak in the area. Multiple findings of HPAIV H5-positive droppings of mallards, teals, and wigeons highlight that ducks can excrete the virus without becoming visibly ill or dying. Since the end of February [2021], many European countries have been reporting increased detection of HPAIV H5 in swans.""Infected but asymptomatic wild birds or those incubating the disease can be seen as mobile virus carriers that have the potential to spread the virus further. Many waterfowl species (e.g., geese, swans, some duck species) move between farmland (especially grassland, maize stubble, and winter rapeseed and cereal crops), where they feed during the day, and resting waters, which they visit in the evening and at night. They can excrete the virus via their droppings and contaminate the land and water that they visit. In addition, sick and dead waterfowl that may be predated by mammals such as foxes and martens, but also birds of prey and crows, may lead to considerable environmental contamination on arable and grazing land in cases where high viral loads exist. Further indirect spread of virus through people or vehicles entering such areas can lead to the introduction of the virus into poultry farms.""Low temperatures in winter stabilize the infectivity of influenza viruses in the environment. When waterfowl congregate in high numbers, virus transmission and spread between wild bird species are facilitated. Due to the fact that not all wild waterfowl can be fully surveilled, the actual spread of HPAI H5 viruses can only be estimated via sporadic case identifications. It must be assumed that the viruses continue to spread in wild birds in Germany, possibly without a noticeable increase in mortality.""The cold arctic air since the beginning of February [2021] has caused snow and ice in northern and central Germany, and more dynamic bird movements can be expected as many water bird species seek out ice-free waters. Under such weather conditions, the infection of wild birds may spread inland and further into southern and western Europe. Swans seem to be particularly frequently affected at present and conspicuous regarding their high HPAIV-related mortality.""The spring migration of northern water birds is currently underway. There are strong migratory movements within Europe from western and southwestern to eastern and northeastern directions (geese, swans, ducks, divers), which could continue to spread HPAI viruses supra-regionally.""Reference 1:Rapid Risk Assessment HPAIV H5 in Germany, Friedrich-Loeffler Institute, 25 Mar 2021. https://www.openagrar.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/openagrar_derivate_00036503/FLI-Risikoeinschaetzung_HPAIV_H5N8_2021-03-25_en-bf.pdf. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map:Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8303400,101] See Also

The H5N8 virus strain has been confirmed in the 2nd wave of the outbreak in the hill state.The deaths have been reported in 2 migratory species namely bar-headed geese and greylag geese at Pong.At least 5006 migratory birds had died until February [2021] in the 1st wave of avian influenza- H5N1 that had hit Pong wetland.In a letter to all CCFs [Chief Conservators of Forests] /CFs [Conservators of Forests] and DFOs [Divisional Forest Officers] across the state, HP [Himachal Pradesh] Principal CCF (wildlife)-cum-Chief Wildlife Warden, Archana Sharma on Wednesday [7 Apr 2021] directed to maintain strict vigil in and around wetland areas where migratory birds are present.All the field officers of HP Forest Department shall report any unnatural behaviour or unnatural death of wild birds or animals to the office of PCCF (WL) [Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Wildlife], the letter said.The affected birds display symptoms such as tremors, diarrhea, head tilt, and paralysis. The disease spreads quickly causing paralysis and staggering, it stated.While dealing with dead birds or animals, proper protective measures should be taken like using gloves, masks, etc., and samples of suspected dead birds may be sent to RDDL [Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory] Jalandhar. Advisories from various agencies of the State Government in this regard should be complied with, the letter added.Rahul Rohane, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Wildlife Division, Hamirpur while talking to The Pioneer said, ""Until now, 110 migratory birds have died since [25 Mar 2021] due to bird flu and carcasses of 10 more migratory birds were found on Wednesday [7 Apr 2021] at Pong Lake.""Rohane said that the Pong Lake had been closed for the visitors and the forest guards have been asked to keep a strict vigil in and around the wetland.Notably, the fresh waterfowl count at Pong Lake has recorded 13 528 birds at the wetland.Every year, more than one lakh [100 000] migratory birds of over 100 species from Siberia and Central Asia descend on Pong wetland for their winter sojourn.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[The Indian subcontinent has experienced HPAI outbreaks due to H5N1 virus infection in domestic poultry and other birds almost every year since the 1st report in 2006. The subtype H5N8 has been reported since November 2016.Many bird species share the same habitats or stopovers during their migration. This high density of several susceptible bird species gathering in the same spot results in effective viral transmission, which is likely to happen through the faecal-oral route via surface waters. Lake Pong is on the trans-Himalayan flyway, with more than 220 bird species that have been identified. - Mod.PMBMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8302428,68302] See Also

The boy recovered. He had exposure to poultry, and the poultry tested positive for H5N6. None of the contacts at home or in the hospital had the disease.This is the 1st avian influenza A(H5N6) case reported to WHO from Laos PDR. To date, a total of 31 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus have been reported (30 in China and 1 in Laos).Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st human case of Influenza A/H5N6 reported from Laos. Laos has also reported human cases of Avian Influenza A/H5 of other N subtypes [https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2007/02/human-h5n1-cases-reported-laos-egypt-china].To date [12 Apr 2021], a total of 29 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus have been reported to WHO from China since 2014. According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various A(H5) sub-types continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe and Asia [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/influenza-at-the-human-animal-interface-summary-and-assessment-29jan2021].The overall risk assessment is unchanged. Most human cases were exposed to A(H5) viruses through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the viruses continue to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected.All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). This includes any influenza A virus that has demonstrated the capacity to infect a human and its haemagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those, i.e. A(H1) or A(H3), circulating widely in the human population. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface. - Mod.UBA] See Also

The NCDC Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Tuesday [6 Apr 2021] in Abuja, while providing highlights of the epidemiological situation and response activities in Nigeria.NAN reports that avian influenza is strains of the influenza virus that primarily infect birds but can also infect humans. This type of flu is most often contracted by contact with sick birds and can also be passed from person to person. It spreads by airborne respiratory droplets (coughs or sneezes).Symptoms begin within 2 to 8 days and are like the common flu. Cough, fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headache and shortness of breath may occur.Ihekweazu said as of 24 Mar 2021, the 7 states reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) cases (H5N1) in poultries. ""Health National Rapid Response Team (RRT) from NCDC and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture were deployed to Bauchi, Kano and Plateau states.""A total of 83 human samples were received and 64 (87.7%) samples were tested. Of the tested samples, 7 (10.9%) were positive for flu A, [and of those 7], 6 (85.7%) were subtype A/H5, while one (14.3%) was unsubtypable,"" he explained.The NCDC boss said official notification about the outbreak had been conveyed to the World Health Organisation (WHO) as required by the International Health Regulations (IHR). He added that an official report had also been sent to the authorities at both the federal level and the affected states.""Avian influenza outbreak emergency operations centre (EOC) at level 1 has been activated at national and in 2 states (Plateau and Gombe). Seven confirmed samples have been shipped to the WHO collaborating centre (WHO-CC) in the United States (US) for further characterisation,"" he noted.Speaking on the response activities, he said the 2nd session of EOC had been conducted with a review of the outbreak situation, response terms of reference (TORs) and incident actions plan (IAPs).""Seven states -- Kano, Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Kaduna, Nasarawa and Niger states -- have confirmed cases of avian influenza among poultry. Two states have reported 7 cases among humans: Kano, 4, and Plateau, 3. Only Kano, Plateau, Bauchi and Gombe states have had human contacts of birds followed up,"" he said.According to him, of the 83 contacts reported, 27 contacts are from 3 local government areas (LGAs): Nasarawa, Ungogo and Gwale in Kano State. The others are 18 contacts from 2 LGAs (Jos North and South) in Plateau; 19 contacts from 2 LGAs (Bauchi and Toro) in Bauchi State, and 19 contacts from 3 LGAs (Kaltungo, Yamaltu Deba and Gombe) in Gombe State.Ihekweazu stated that all contacts were farmers, farmworkers, bird handlers and traders, adding that the contacts were still asymptomatic except one who presented catarrh.""A total of 83 humans nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples have been collected from contacts of confirmed birds in 4 states: Kano (27), Plateau (18), Bauchi (19) and Gombe (19). A total of 13 blood samples have also been collected from the very-close contacts (human) of the birds in 3 states: Plateau (3), Bauchi (5), and Gombe (5).""Of 83 human samples collected, 64 (87.7%) samples were analysed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of 64 samples analysed, only 7 (10.9%) were positive for Flu A. Of the 7 samples positive for Flu A, only 6 (85.7%) were positive for A/H5 while one (14.3%) was unsubtypable. All 7 positive samples have been shipped to WHO-CC for further lab analysis,"" he said.The NCDC boss noted that sensitisation was carried out by the national and state RRT to farm owners, workers, live bird market (LBM) associations and communities in the affected states. He added that biosecurity measures were extensively discussed for the benefit of the farmers and communities.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[Based on the above report, A/H5 (N subtype not determined as yet) influenza has been reported in human samples from 7 states in Nigeria following outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) cases (H5N1) in poultry in the last week of March 2021. HPAI virus (HPAIV) H5N1 was first officially reported in Africa in 2006; thereafter, this virus has spread rapidly from Nigeria to 11 other African countries. Nigeria confirmed its 1st human case of avian flu A/H5N1 in January 2007 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5682264/). Recent reported data indicate that there is co-circulation/endemicity of multiple subtypes of avian influenza viruses (H5N8, H5N6 and H9N2) in the country, which can present diagnostic challenges as well (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1757999). Influenza presents a constant example where joint activities by public health and animal health sectors vis-a-vis ""One Health"" actions are required to strengthen surveillance efforts and to contain and monitor virus spread and the emergence of novel viruses of animal and public health concern.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific high-risk tasks, such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, and litter, and cleaning of contaminated premises, should be trained on how to protect themselves and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Thorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new influenza A subtype with the potential to cause a pandemic (please see case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR). Evidence of illness is not required.For further information and details, please see:- Current technical information including monthly risk assessments at the Human-Animal Interface WHO- Case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR (2005)- International Health Regulations IHR (2005)- Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza (2011)- Terms of Reference for National Influenza Centers of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System- Mod.UBASince late December 2020, 4 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks have been reported in Nigeria's poultry, of which the 1st one affected a backyard holding, while the last 3 involved commercial or semi-commercial poultry farms. The single, thus far, follow-up report (No. 1), addressing 3 outbreaks, was submitted to the OIE on 15 Feb 2021; it includes a map and is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=38247. All infected flocks were culled.Human-to-human infection by HPAI H5N1 is not common and sporadically recorded in Asian countries and Egypt. - Mod.ASThe ongoing avian influenza outbreak in poultry has now led to human cases in Kano, Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Nasarawa, Kaduna, and Niger states. This is not surprising with the large poultry farms and other smallholdings in the affected states. Kano, Plateau, and Bauchi states reported cases of avian influenza in poultry earlier in 2021 (see ProMED-EAFR post Avian influenza - Nigeria (02): poultry, H5N1, OIE 20210218.8197059). - Mod.AAHealthMap/ProMED map:Nigeria: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8294492,62] See Also

For example: Colonel Mustard in the library with a candlestick.Now, imagine you have no idea what the weapons are.That's the predicament scientists have been in for over 25 years as they tried to nail down what was killing bald eagles in the southeastern United States. Teams of researchers at the University of Georgia's Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and the Institute of Pharmacy at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany have finally put the clues together and solved the mystery.Eagles began dying in large numbers in 1994 because of a disease called avian vacuolar myelinopathy that caused holes to form in the white matter of their brains, according to a study published this week [week of 29 Mar 2021] in the journal Science [see reference below]. The disease was soon also found in other birds of prey and waterfowl, amphibians, reptiles, and fish.""Despite intense research efforts, the cause of this mysterious disease has been elusive,"" the study said.The deaths were occurring in man-made lakes in Arkansas, Texas, Georgia, and North and South Carolina where certain cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, was growing on the invasive _Hydrilla verticillata_ plant. The hydrilla thrives in man-made lakes that don't have enough nutrients for native species, according to The Atlantic.Susan Wilde, an associate professor of aquatic science at the Warner School, first identified the cyanobacteria that were named _Aetokthonos hydrillicola_, Latin for ""eagle killer that grows on hydrilla,"" according to UGA Today [News Center for the University of Georgia].The researchers assumed _Aetokthonos_ was creating a neurotoxin that caused the brain-destroying vacuolar myelinopathy. However, _Aetokthonos_ cultures grown in the lab did not cause the disease.It was a mystery. What was the weapon _Aetokthonos_ was using to kill the eagles, turtles, and fish?Professor Timo Niedermeyer of the Institute of Pharmacy began collaborating with Wilde and her group.Using a new imaging mass spectrometer, one of Niedermeyer's researchers examined leaves of hydrilla collected in the field. At the molecular level, the researcher found a chemical structure made up of 5 bromine atoms. The cyanobacteria cultures grown in the lab had no bromide.""The structure is really spectacular,"" the researcher, Steffen Breinlinger, told UGA Today. ""We then added bromide to our lab cultures, and the cyanobacteria started producing the toxin.""The teams proved the bromine molecule does trigger vacuolar myelinopathy. They call their discovery aetokthonotoxin, ""poison that kills the eagle.""""Finally, we did not only catch the murderer, but we also identified the weapon the cyanobacteria used to kill those eagles,"" Wilde said.Bromine can occur in lakes naturally, but it also gets into the environment from power plants, fungicides, and gasoline additives, the study said. Coincidentally, some herbicides used to control hydrilla also contain bromide.The study said the consequences of elevated bromide levels on vacuolar myelinopathy should be investigated more, and efforts to control hydrilla should avoid using bromide-containing chemicals.Wilde said people also should be aware of the possibility of animals and fish being affected by vacuolar myelinopathy before taking them from the man-made lakes. The disease can cause the animals to make erratic movements or have convulsions.""For fish, it's tough. I would avoid eating fish with lesions or some sort of deformities; we do see affected fish with slow swimming speeds, but anglers won't be able to see that,"" Wilde said. ""We want people to know the lakes where this disease has been documented and to use caution in consuming birds and fish from these lakes.""Maps compiled by Wilde and her students show locations where vacuolar myelinopathy has been documented in birds in the Southeast.The news of this discovery came the same week the U.S. Department of the Interior announced the number of American bald eagles has quadrupled since 2009. Once on the brink of extinction, bald eagles now number over 300 000.[Byline: Ron Brackett]---Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Forty years ago, bald eagles (_Haliaeetus leucocephalus_) were in danger throughout most of their range. Habitat protection afforded by the Endangered Species Act, the federal government's banning of DDT, and conservation actions taken by the American public helped bald eagles make a remarkable recovery.Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM), was first detected in 1994 when 29 bald eagles were found dead during the fall and winter at De Gray Lake in southwestern Arkansas. The most consistent finding across species, locations, and years is a microscopic change or ""lesion"" in the brain and spinal cord of affected birds.This disorder is diagnosed by microscopic examination of very fresh brain tissue. It appears as open spaces in the white matter (myelinated areas) of the central nervous system in affected birds. Recent studies had implicated exotic hydrilla and associated epiphytic cyanobacterial species as a link to AVM (Environ Toxicol 20: 348-353)._Hydrilla_ is an aquatic plant invasive in the United States following release in the 1960s from aquariums into waterways in Florida. It is now established in the southeast from Connecticut to Texas. _Hydrilla_ can be controlled by the application of aquatic herbicides and it is also eaten by grass carp, itself an invasive species in North America. This new study established the mechanism by which a _Hydrilla_-associated cyanobacterium causes AVM by producing a toxin that contains bromide.Reference---------Breinlinger S, Phillips TJ, Haram BN, et al.

The majority of HPAI H5 virus detections in wild and domestic birds within Europe coincide with southwest/westward fall migration and large local waterbird aggregations during wintering.""The brent goose (_Branta bernicla_) breeds on the arctic coasts of Eurasia and North America, mainly on small islets free of Arctic Foxes. It is migratory, wintering at temperate latitudes or at more southern latitudes during severe winters. _Branta b. bernicla_, breeding in North Russia, predominantly on the Taymyr Peninsula, stages in Wadden Sea and winters mainly in The Netherlands, South England, and North west France. _Branta b. hrota_ from Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land winters mainly in Denmark and may reach England and The Netherlands during severe winters. The separate population _B. b. hrota_ from Greenland and Northeast Canada mainly winters in Ireland. Some of these birds reach the British coasts and also maybe France.The brent goose is a colonial nesting bird. The incidence of infection with HPAI H5N1 has been found to vary with age. A study of the seroprevalence of known age black brant revealed that no birds <4 years old had seroconverted, compared to 49% of birds ≥4 years of age (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057614). - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of France: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8280942,68275] See Also

However, that rule is due to end on Wednesday [31 Mar 2021] after the risk was reduced to ""medium"" earlier this month [March].Cases have been confirmed all over the UK, but this is the 1st case in Staffordshire or the West Midlands. Staffordshire County Council has urged anyone with poultry in the county to be alert to signs of bird flu and reminded owners to keep birds housed.[Byline: Jordan Reynolds]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Europe, including UK and Ireland, has been suffering since October 2020 from a widely spread outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, detected in various and numerous wild birds while affecting commercial poultry farms. Subscribers may wish to visit the 2 EC (ADNS)-updated maps ""HPAI detections during the period 12-19 Mar 2021"" and ""HPAI detections during the period 1 Oct 2020-19 Mar 2021,"" both available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_hapai_chrono_2021_map.pdf. The more recent map reflects the diminished incidence on the British Isles compared to continental Europe. The above-described outbreak in Staffordshire is exceptional and might become one of the last events during the season.According to a later report from the same media source, the above outbreak has affected a broiler flock; HPAI H5N8 has been confirmed. Most of the outbreaks in Europe during the recent season were caused by HPAI H5N8, while 3 other serotypes -- H5N1, H5N5 and H5N3 -- have been identified as well, particularly in wild birds.As stated in a recent DEFRA/APHA (Animal & Plant Health Agency) assessment, the detection of 4 HPAI H5 subtypes in the same epidemic event is unparalleled in the UK. All these viruses are genetically closely related through their H5 haemagglutinin gene, which is the key viral gene influencing pathogenesis, host range, transmission, and host immunity. Continued alteration to circulating viruses following co-infection and genetic reassortment in wild birds is not unexpected. Although to date, the viruses characterised have been of high sequence identity across isolates of the same subtype, further genetic variation at genome level may occur.

The area would be monitored and checked by authorities and research would determine the source of the disease in 30 days.""Relevant authorities also have to monitor the movements of birds within a 10 km [6 mi] radius of the outbreak area and report any death of birds to the provincial agriculture department for veterinary measures,"" Sakhon said.The provincial administration has also issued an urgent notice banning residents in the area from handling the dead birds as it could lead to H5N1 spreading from wild birds to domestic ones. It could also endanger human health.Puth Bo, community chief in the Tuolporn Taley Boeung Sne area, said community members and specialists had collected and destroyed 135 bird carcasses, raising the total to nearly 2000 since [17 Mar 2021].""For now, villagers were very fearful after the agriculture ministry announced the results of the tests were H5N1,"" he said, adding that all his villagers could face a temporary evacuation from the area for 30 days because the village is close to the area.However, Ba Phnom district governor Tep Phearun said that local authorities had decided not to evacuate villagers from the commune but had temporarily prohibited them from guiding tourists to visit the area. Villagers, he said, have also been advised against grazing animals in the area as the virus could be transmitted to domestic animals, or even to humans.""No evacuation has happened, but we asked villagers to keep the environment around their homes clean,"" he said.[Byline: Khouth Sophak Chakrya]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[The Asian openbill (_Anastomus oscitans_) is a stork found mainly in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

The case involved a 50-year-old man living in Hechi in Guangxi. He developed symptoms on [16 Feb 2021] and was admitted for treatment on [17 Feb 2021] due to severe pneumonia. The patient passed away on [2 Mar 2021].From 2014 to date, 30 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by China mainland health authorities.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. The clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches), or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza viruses through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[China's 1st avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N6 strain was isolated in March 2014 from a domestic duck in Guangdong Province. Since then, the H5 subtype has gradually become the main cause of the sporadic AIV infections in poultry in southern China. To date, a total of 25 laboratory-confirmed cases (excluding the case above) of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 7 deaths at the time of the IHR (International Health Regulations) report, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014 (https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/).According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. With the continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map of China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8265645,11869] See Also

Following histopathological examination of tissues from the fox and seals identified lesions indicative of acute systemic viral infection, further laboratory testing was performed at APHA. This testing resulted in the detection of H5N8 influenza virus infection. Gene sequencing identified this H5N8 influenza virus to be [99.9%] identical to avian-origin H5N8 viruses detected from the mute swans that had died and been tested from this wildlife rescue centre. In November 2020, 5 wild mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) that had been rescued and taken to a wildlife rescue centre died, were tested and found to be infected with H5N8 HPAI. Retrospective investigation of the deaths of 5 seals -- 4 common seals (_Phoca vitulina_) and one grey seal (_Halichoerus grypus_) -- and one red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) approximately one week later at the same wildlife rescue centre resulted in the finding of H5N8 influenza virus infection. These were all wild animals temporarily located at the wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre. Comorbidities were not investigated, and it is possible that other factors may have influenced disease severity. Infection of mammalian species is a rare event, with no prior authenticated cases of H5N8 infection in foxes. All laboratory investigations and testing were performed at APHA. Test results confirm both the H5N8 influenza virus being of avian origin and the source hypothesis as the mute swans at the rescue centre that were also H5N8 positive. There was no evidence of spread of infection from the wildlife rescue centre.Control measures applied in wild: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; disinfectionDiagnostic test resultsLaboratory name and type: Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)Species / Test / Test date / ResultRed fox / Virus isolation / 25 Jan 2021 / PositiveHarbor seal, red fox, gray seal / Gene sequencing / 26 Jan 2021 / PositiveHarbor seal, red fox, gray seal / Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 22 Jan 2021 / PositiveFuture reportingThe event is continuing.

The agency determined the birds are contracting salmonellosis, a disease cause by salmonella bacteria, by sharing bird feeders with other infected avian species. Pine siskins, a species of finch that winters in California, are the primary species affected by the outbreak, along with a small number of goldfinches.""When there is a disease circulating in the population, bird feeders ensure the birds remain in really close contact with one another, as well as other birds, as they use the feeder (think of having to share one dinner plate or one water glass with your whole family as well as with everyone in your neighborhood without washing it between each individual),"" Krysta Rogers, senior environmental scientist with CDFW told DailyMail.com in an email.""Bird feeders also keep the birds in one location for longer periods of time allowing feces to build up. If there are sick birds in that group, they will shed the salmonella bacteria in their feces, contaminating the area, leading to more and more birds becoming sick and dying from the infection as they try to access the feeder or feed on the spilled seeds under the feeder. The most effective way to slow the spread of this infection and reduce mortality is to remove the bird feeders because that is primarily where this disease spreads.""Salmonellosis is an infection with a salmonella bacteria [sic] that lives in the intestinal tracts of animals, including birds. And it can be transmitted to humans who eat food contaminated with animal feces. The disease is found to spread to birds during the winter months and has occurred in California previous years.The last event was between December 2019 and April 2020, but only 110 dead birds were reported, but Rogers says, ""only about a quarter were suspected of having salmonellosis. Our lab confirmed salmonellosis in several birds including pine siskins and goldfinches submitted for testing, so it appears the infection was circulating at a relatively low level within the population last winter,"" she continued.However, this outbreak appears to be more rampant and specifically along California's coast. The highest number of reports are from Sonoma (228), Santa Clara (231), Marin (173), Contra Costa (150), San Mateo (143), Santa Cruz (115), Alameda (109), Sacramento (109) and Placer (72) counties.""Salmonellosis occurs periodically in pine siskins in some winters throughout their range. When large numbers of pine siskins congregate, the disease can spread rapidly causing high mortality,"" Rogers shared in a statement. Most birds die within 24 hours of infection. Birds that are sick will often have ruffled feathers and move slowly. Some also experience labored breathing or their eyes may appear swollen and partially closed. If you find a bird that looks ill, the CDFW urges you to wear disposable gloves and wash hands if you plan on disposing of the carcass, along with handling birdfeeders.""It is unclear if salmonella bacteria completely disappear from the population. It may be that some birds recover, but still carry low levels of bacteria in their intestinal tract, and under certain conditions become more susceptible to developing the disease,"" said Roger. ""Most salmonellosis outbreaks end when the pine siskins return to their breeding grounds, typically late March or April. On their breeding grounds, pine siskins are more dispersed for breeding activities like nest building and raising chicks, so infection tends to be less common.""[byline: Stacy Liberatore]--communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It would be important to know which strain of salmonella is implicated, as of that depends its zoonotic potential, or its risk to domestic animals. A common salmonella isolated from passerine birds is _Salmonella typhimurium_, which can cause diarrhea in humans and livestock.Being gregarious, siskins are particularly susceptible to contagion.

According to the statement, these measures aim to preserve the livestock and economic resources of poultry farmers. The statement did not mention additional details about the extent of the virus spread or the number of dead poultry.Last month [February 2021], Algeria declared a state of high alert after the World Organisation for Animal Health announced the registration of a bird flu focus in the eastern state of Oum El Bouaghi (adjacent to the state of Batna), which was spotted at the end of last January [2021].The Ministry of Agriculture attributed the source of the virus at the time to migratory birds and confirmed that ""the epidemic has been brought under control.""Laboratory analyzes revealed the spread of avian influenza in the Ain Fakroun region in the state of Umm El-Bouaghi, and 51 200 chickens were affected, most of them dead, before the area was isolated [see comment].--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[For the location of the town Seriana in the Algerian province Batna, see map at https://tinyurl.com/vp7msw.The previously mentioned event in Ain Fakroun, Oum El Bouaghi was reported by the Algerian authorities to the OIE in an immediate notification dated 8 Feb 2021 (see 20210211.8183060).

This might be explained by multiple reassortments with low pathogenic viruses circulating in wild birds. The evolution of the viruses and these recent events need to be closely monitored and further studied in order to assess the risks.""It is most likely that migratory wild birds, followed by local farming practices, have contributed to the dissemination and introduction of the virus into new countries and farms. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics in many countries associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17.""The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new subtypes, which were also reported by countries.""What factors can facilitate the spread of avian influenza?""The dynamic of the spread of influenza viruses is extremely complex and difficult to predict. Several factors can influence it, such as the wild bird migration pattern, unregulated trade, farming systems, biosecurity and immunity status.""During the Northern Hemisphere winter, the wild bird movements may increase, and lower temperatures may facilitate the environmental survival of AI viruses, increasing exposure of infection in poultry. Additionally, the mixing of wild birds from different geographic origins during migration can increase the risk of virus spread and genetic reassortment resulting in changes in viral properties.""At [a] local level, as the AI viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, they can be easily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of infected animals, as well as contaminated boots, vehicles and equipment if the adequate biosecurity measures are not implemented.""What is the risk of avian influenza for human health?""The epidemiology of AI viruses is complex: They can change and evolve by mutation and reassortment, with the emergence of new subtypes causing significant impacts on animal health and production. Some subtypes -- not all -- can be zoonotic and therefore pose a threat to human health.""Transmission of AI viruses to humans occurs when there is close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments.""In February 2021, human cases of AI subtype H5N8 were reported by Russian authorities to the World Health Organization (WHO). The OIE/FAO network of experts on animal influenza (OFFLU) analyzed the preliminary information of the event and stated that, to date, there is no evidence to suggest that severe human infections or human-to-human transmission of this virus have occurred. This situation likely represents an isolated spillover event of the virus, as genetic evidence suggests that these viruses were derived from chickens with no adaptation to humans.""More information is available on the OFFLU statement (February 2021) at http://www.offlu.net/fileadmin/home/en/publications/pdf/OFFLU_Russia_H5N8_final.pdf."" - Mod.CRD] See Also

These are the 1st reported detections of avian influenza A(H5N8) in humans.Positive clinical specimens were collected from poultry farm workers who participated in a response operation to contain an avian influenza A(H5N8) outbreak detected in a poultry farm in Astrakhan Oblast in the Russian Federation. The laboratory confirmation of the 7 specimens was performed by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR (WHO H5 Reference Laboratory). The ages of the 7 positive cases ranged between 29 to 60 years, and 5 were female.Between 3 and 11 Dec 2020, a total of 101 000 out of 900 000 egg-laying hens on the farm died. This high mortality rate prompted an investigation. Samples were collected from these birds, and an initial detection of avian influenza A(H5N8) was performed by the Russian regional veterinary laboratory. On 11 Dec 2020, the outbreak was confirmed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference laboratory, and the Federal Centre for Animal Health (FGBI-ARRIAH), in Vladimir, the Russian Federation. Outbreak containment operations started immediately and continued for several days due to the large size of the poultry farm.The cases remained asymptomatic for the whole follow up duration (several weeks). Follow up nasopharyngeal swabs were collected during the medical observation period and were tested negative for avian influenza A(H5N8). No obvious clinical manifestations were reported from any farm workers under medical surveillance, their family members, or other close contacts of the 7 cases. Additionally, acute and convalescent sera were collected from the 7 positive human cases for serological testing. The results were suggestive of recent infection.Influenza A(H5N8) viruses isolated from this poultry outbreak in Astrakhan belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b of avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses. In 2020, avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses were also detected in poultry or wild birds in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation.On receiving the initial signal of a probable outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) at the poultry farm on 3 Dec 2020, the national authorities took immediate measures including cessation of poultry production cycles and product transportation from the affected farm.Between 11 and 18 Dec 2020, several measures, including culling and disposing of poultry, eggs, and litter, and disinfection of contaminated premises, were taken as part of outbreak response activities.During and after the culling of all the poultry, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum samples were collected from poultry farm workers and personnel involved in outbreak response at the farm. Surveillance activities, both within and outside of the containment area, were intensified. A total of 24 close contacts of the confirmed cases have been identified and traced. In total, 150 individuals were monitored for clinical indication of respiratory disease, and they received antiviral prophylaxis therapy. No symptoms were reported among these individuals.Whole Genome Sequencing of avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses isolated from poultry and from one of the 7 human cases was performed and uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database on 20 Feb 2021. Genetic and phenotypic characterization of the virus is ongoing.WHO is following up with public health authorities in the Russian Federation, including implementation of public health measures warranted by such events, and with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) on further analysis and assessment of the virus materials and serum samples. On 20 Feb 2021, a special briefing by the head of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing was organized for the state Russian media to inform the public about these cases and the implications.Since 2004, avian influenza A(H5) viruses have spread from Asia to Europe via wild birds. The genetic clade 2.3.4.4 H5 viruses have often reassorted among other avian influenza viruses, resulting in avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N5), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses, some of which have been detected in birds in many countries.In the Russian Federation, avian influenza A(H5N8) of clade 2.3.4.4 was isolated for the 1st time in 2014 in a wild bird in the northern region of the Russian Far East.As mentioned earlier, all the 7 cases with PCR-positive results were clinically asymptomatic. All close contacts of these cases were clinically monitored, and no one showed signs of clinical illness. Infections with avian influenza viruses of the same clade (H5 clade 2.3.4.4) have been reported from China since 2014 in people with exposure to infected birds. The likelihood of human infections with influenza A(H5N8) viruses has been considered to be low.Further genetic and antigenic characterization and information on seroconversion among contacts of the positive cases is required to fully assess the risk.The development of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses for potential use in human vaccines, coordinated by WHO, remains an essential component of the overall global strategy for influenza pandemic preparedness.Based on currently available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low.These cases do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of animal and seasonal human influenza, which should continue to be implemented. Respiratory transmission occurs mainly by droplets, disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes. Short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses may occur, particularly in crowded enclosed spaces. Hand contamination, direct inoculation of virus, exposure to infected birds or virus-contaminated materials or environments are potential sources of infection.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific, high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, and litter, and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on how to protect themselves, and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Thorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new influenza A subtype with the potential to cause a pandemic (please see case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR). Evidence of illness is not required.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection, a thorough epidemiological investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted, even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.Based on the currently available information, WHO advises against any special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions on travel and/or trade with the Russian Federation.For further information and details, please see:- Current technical information including monthly risk assessments at the Human-Animal Interface WHO- WHO Influenza virus infections in humans October 2018- Case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR (2005)- International Health Regulations IHR (2005)- Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza (2011)- Terms of Reference for National Influenza Centers of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.--Communicated by:ProMED Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[The above report provides additional details about the 7 human cases of avian influenza A/H5N8 reported almost one week ago. No new cases have been identified since then.Now that human cases have been reported for this avian influenza subtype, preparedness for future such events requires continued monitoring and surveillance of the circulating viruses in animals and humans. - Mod.UBA][According to the Russian report, the 7 individuals found infected by the H5N8 virus strain remained asymptomatic for the whole follow up duration. Checking persons in close contact with HPAI H5N8-affected domestic or wild birds deserves to be undertaken in other affected countries in order to get more information on the zoonotic impact of this widely-spread virus strain. The above report mentions 13 such countries. According a recent update, HPAI H5N8 in poultry and/or wild birds has been recently reported from 31 countries, of which 21 are in Europe, 8 in Asia (of which 2 are in the Middle East) and 2 in Africa. The full list, covering the period 27 Jan 2021-23 Feb 2021, is available in Table 1 of the most recent update of FAO-EMPRES ""Animal Health Global AIV with Zoonotic Potential situation update,"" published 24 Feb 2021.

Now, along with illegal hunting, there are other environmental threats, including water pollution and wastewater flow and lack of provision of wetlands' water rights, [that] cause the management of migratory birds' habitats to get out of control.The long and narrow peninsula is 48 kilometers (about 30 mi) long, and between 1.3 and 3.2 kilometers (about 0.8 and 2.0 mi) wide, which sets apart the Gorgan Bay from the Caspian Sea. Four villages, namely, Ashuradeh, Qezel-e Shomali, Qezel-Mehdi, and Qavasatl, are situated on the peninsula.Miankaleh was designated a Ramsar site in 1975. Major habitats include wetlands, inter-tidal mud with sandy shores, shallow marine waters, forests, peatlands, and agricultural areas. It is home to many unique Caspian birds and reptile species native to this region. It's also a very important internationally recognized refuge for migratory birds.The peninsula water deficits, additionally mismanagement, unsustainable agricultural practices, and severe depletion of the wells and groundwater resources, have exacerbated the Miankaleh peninsula's condition.Local people earn their income from agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, carpet weaving, traditional poultry farming, and tourism. Overgrazing, illegal hunting, fishing, deforestation, and the unplanned spread of villages are some of the challenges posing threat to the region's environment.--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent by type E. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map:Iran: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8211249,128] See Also

Since then, a new wave of epizootic outbreaks of H5N8 have been continuously reported in several European countries especially in wild birds, but also in poultry starting from mid-October (2020). ""The current HPAI H5 epidemic is still progressing in Europe, Asia and Africa causing severe impact due to dead and culled birds in the infected premises. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17. Report of increased number of outbreaks in wild birds indicate periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season. Consequently, improving on-farm biosecurity measures is a priority to reduce the likelihood of exposure to poultry. ""Veterinary Authorities in the affected countries have responded to contain outbreaks in poultry with stamping out measures, heightened surveillance, and recommendations to poultry owners to increase biosecurity.""

We have sounded alert and stepped surveillance to check the spread of this virus,"" Sunil Kumar Thakur, district animal husbandry officer, West Champaran, told Down To Earth.Thakur added that the virus is not ""deadly"" and suggested people consume chickens as usual without any fear: ""People panic in the absence of proper information. I suggest them to consume chickens without nursing any fear.""He said the department had asked all block-level animal husbandry officials to promptly inform about the death of birds and collect samples for testing. ""We are examining all poultry farms in the district,"" he said.The state animal husbandry department issued a high alert in the areas and formed quick-response teams in case the situation deteriorates, said its Muzaffarpur-based regional director Manoj Das.""It is destroyed at 80 deg C [176 deg F],"" Das said, indicating cooked poultry meat or eggs were safe.Former animal husbandry official, Shailendra Kr Sinha, said the H5N8 strain is as life-threatening for humans as it is for birds: ""From the poultry, it spreads to human beings. People must be careful.""Deaths of hundreds of crows, fowls, and owls were reported from various parts of the state in the last 2 months, following which a large number of samples were sent for tests. In January [2021] alone, the animal husbandry department sent as many as 531 avian influenza samples for tests to Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory, Kolkata, all of which had tested negative.The bird flu outbreak has been reported from at least 13 Indian states so far, including Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Jammu and Kashmir.Infection in humans has not been reported in India, though the disease is zoonotic. ""There is no direct evidence that AI viruses can be transmitted to humans via consumption of contaminated poultry products,"" the statement said.Implementing management practices that incorporate bio-security principles, personal hygiene, cleaning and disinfection protocols, as well as cooking and processing standards are effective means of controlling the spread of the AI viruses, the statement added.[Byline: CK Manoj]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The Indian Subcontinent has experienced HPAI outbreaks due to H5N1 virus infection in domestic poultry and other birds almost every year since the 1st report in 2006.

Other strains -- H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 -- have been known here to spread to humans.Russia reported the case of human infection to the WHO ""several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results,"" Popova said on Rossiya 24 state TV. There was no sign yet of transmission between humans, she added.Seven workers at a poultry plant in Russia's south had been infected with the H5N8 strain in an outbreak at the plant in December [2020], Popova said, adding that the individuals involved felt fine now. ""This situation did not develop further,"" she said.In an email, WHO's European arm said it had been notified by Russia about a case of human infection with H5N8 and acknowledged that this would, if confirmed, be the 1st time the strain had infected people.""Preliminary information indicates that the reported cases were workers exposed to bird flocks,"" the email said. ""They were asymptomatic, and no onward human-to-human transmission was reported. We are in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and assess the public health impact of this event,"" the email added.The majority of human bird flu infections have been associated with direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered to be safe.Bird flu outbreaks often prompt poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus from spreading and to avoid importing countries having to impose trade restrictions.The vast majority of cases are spread by migrating wild birds, so producing countries tend to keep their poultry indoors or protected from contact with wildlife.Siberia's Vector Institute said on Sat 20 Feb 2021 that it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, RIA news agency reported.[Byline: Polina Devitt, Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber]--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: 22 Feb 2021Source: BBC [abridged, edited]https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56140270Russia has reported the 1st case of a bird flu strain, H5N8, being passed from poultry to humans.Officials said 7 workers at a poultry plant in the south of the country had been infected following an outbreak there in December 2020.""All 7 people are now feeling well,"" said the head of Russia's consumer health watchdog, Anna Popova. She said that adequate measures had been quickly taken to stop the spread of infection.There was no sign of transmission between humans, Ms Popova said, adding that the case had been reported to the World Health Organization.She praised ""the important scientific discovery"" by Russia's Vektor laboratory, which had isolated the strain's genetic material from the infected workers.""The discovery of these mutations when the virus has not still acquired an ability to transmit from human to human gives us all, the entire world, time to prepare for possible mutations and react in an adequate and timely fashion,"" Ms Popova said.She said Russian scientists could now start working on developing test systems.Other strains of bird flu occasionally infect humans and have led to deaths, but this is the 1st report of the H5N8 strain being passed on.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[Avian influenza or ""bird flu"" is a disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. It can affect all species of birds, some other animals (e.g., cats, horses) and can very rarely infect humans. Only virus types H5 and H7 are known to cause the highly pathogenic (HPAI) form of the disease. The most well-known examples are the avian influenza subtype H5N1 viruses currently circulating in poultry in parts of Asia and northeast Africa, which have caused human disease and deaths since 1997. Other avian influenza subtypes, including H7N9 and H9N2, have also infected people. Some of these infections have been very severe, and some have resulted in deaths, but many infections have been mild or even without symptoms in humans.H5N8 is a subtype of the influenza A virus, which is highly lethal in wild birds and poultry. Poultry outbreaks due to influenza A/H5N8 have been reported as early as 1983 in Ireland, and since 2010, H5N8-associated outbreaks were detected among wild birds in Asia with subsequent spread to domestic birds across China, South Korea, and Japan [1-3]. In 2016, a novel reassortant virus of subtype H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 was reported in Russia, with further spread to many countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East [4-5].The spread of HPAI (H5N8) strains has been linked to the overlapping flyways of migratory wild birds that come from different continents; this mingling of wild birds poses a major concern worldwide [6-7].All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). This includes any influenza A virus that has demonstrated the capacity to infect humans when its haemagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those -- i.e. A(H1) or A(H3) -- circulating widely in the human population. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface [8].The above newswires report the 1st human cases of avian influenza A/H5N8 and highlight the potential for zoonotic transmission of this novel subtype and other influenza viruses and the need for continuous monitoring and surveillance of the circulating strains in animals and humans. In this regard, Global influenza surveillance has been conducted through WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) since 1952, with key objectives:- Global mechanism of surveillance, preparedness and response for seasonal, pandemic and zoonotic influenza;- Global platform for monitoring influenza epidemiology and disease; and- Global alert for novel influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens.There are enough historical events that have resulted in limited or global pandemics due to influenza, and more recently, novel SARS-CoV2, that highlight the need for a One Health approach towards public health preparedness.H5N8 is typically not associated with humans; however, as per the recent reports from various sources, up to 7 people in Russia have been found to be infected with the virus to date.References:1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N82.

This is the 1st case of avian influenza in Latvia, the Food and Veterinary Service (PVD) said [10 Feb 2021].The Ministry of Agriculture intends, on the basis of information provided by the PVD, to impose additional biosecurity measures for poultry keepers throughout the country, including ban of keeping poultry outdoors in order to prevent direct or indirect contact with wild birds.The PVD calls on owners of birds not to let them outside or keep them in fenced structures before any restrictions are imposed, to avoid contact of poultry with wild birds, particularly water birds (swans, ducks), and refrain from purchasing poultry in other European countries during the winter and forthcoming spring months.Poultry owners should notify the PVD immediately if signs of disease are observed in birds: significantly decreased intake of food and water, increased mortality.On the other hand, citizens are asked to report on dead wild water birds by calling the PVD trust phone 67027402 or by informing the local authority of the nearby PVD.Under no circumstances should birds be brought home or taken to animal shelters.""This influenza is highly contagious, highly pathogenic, which means that all infected birds are exposed to death and extinction sooner or later,"" said Madara Volka, head of the monitoring department of infectious diseases of the PVD.Highly pathogenic avian influenza is an acute, highly contagious avian infectious disease characterized by high mortality. The clinical signs of the disease are sudden and rapid development of the disease, fatigue, withdrawal of food, disheveled feathers, wobbling, choking, etc. The virus's spreaders are wild birds, particularly waterfowl, for which the disease can occur without the symptoms.Poultry can be infected by coming into contact with infected wild birds, for example by accessing ponds and other bodies of water. Similarly, birds may be infected with contaminated feed or objects (footwear, clothing, equipment) on which the virus has landed.In 2021, highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds has been detected in 20 European countries and in poultry -- in 16 European countries.Avian influenza subtypes circulating in European countries do not endanger human health, but the disease is a serious threat to the poultry sector in Latvia.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[Some migratory flyways of Anatidae that may carry HPAI viruses pass over or near Latvia. For example, the North Sea flyway joins the wetlands of northwestern Russia to western Europe wintering sites and runs through Scandinavia, the Baltic basin, and the North Sea.

Since then, a new wave of epizootic outbreaks of H5N8 has been continuously reported in several European countries especially in wild birds, but also in poultry starting from mid-October [2020]. The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1 HPAI virus, which were also reported by countries. There has been continued virus change by genetic reassortment in wild birds resulting in other H5 subtypes like H5N3 and H5N4 also reported by few countries in the current epidemic wave.""""To summarize, the current HPAI H5 epidemic is still progressing in Europe, Asia, and Africa causing severe impact due to dead and culled birds in the infected premises. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17. Report of increased number of outbreaks in wild birds indicate periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season. Consequently, improving on-farm biosecurity measures is a priority to reduce the likelihood of exposure to poultry.""Veterinary Authorities in the affected countries have responded to contain outbreaks in poultry with stamping out measures, heightened surveillance, and recommendations to poultry owners to increase biosecurity"".Source: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Report no 21: 15 Jan to 4 Feb 2021, World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department; available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/HPAI___asof04022021.pdfAs was mentioned in ProMED-mail posting 20210205.8166203, given the presence HPAI H5N8 in the region, there is a high likelihood that this recent outbreak reported by Bulgaria is also associated with this same subtype.To date, no human cases of infection with HPAI H5N8 have been reported. - Mod.CRD] See Also

Confirmation and sequencing analyses were carried out at the Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI, Mittelhausern, Switzerland) where highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N4 was confirmed on [4 Feb 2021]. It is the 1st confirmation of this subtype in Switzerland. However, this is the same strain already confirmed recently in the region of Lake Constance in Germany. Following confirmation of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds on the German side of Lake Constance, the FSVO and the Cantons concerned preventively established control and surveillance zones along the shores of the lake and parts of the river Rhein on [25 Jan 2021]. A control zone of a width of one km was established along the shores of Lake Constance and along the shores of nearby parts of the river Rhein. In the Canton of Schaffhausen, the control zone includes almost the entire territory. Poultry in the control zone area are obliged to be kept such that contact between poultry and wild birds is prevented. The surveillance zone covers a 3-km wide zone along the shore of Lake Constance and along the shores of nearby parts of the river Rhein. In the surveillance zone, poultry holders are obliged to notify veterinarians or the cantonal authorities about any suspicious symptoms of disease in poultry. The affected gull was found within the existing control zone.Control measuresMeasures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, zoning, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animalsMeasures to be applied: no other measuresDiagnostic test resultsLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / ResultNational Reference Centre for Diseases of Poultry and Rabbits (NRGK) (National laboratory) / Yellow-legged Gull: _Larus michahellis_ / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 4 Feb 2021 / PositiveFuture reportingThe event is continuing.

Rangers found the pelicans on [23 Jan 2021] in the Djoudj bird sanctuary, a remote pocket of wetland near the border with Mauritania and a resting place for birds that cross the Sahara Desert into West Africa each year. The birds were incinerated and the park is closed, said Bocar Thiam, Senegal's parks director.The sanctuary is a transit place for about 350 species of birds but only pelicans were found dead.This month [January 2021], Senegal reported an outbreak of H5N1 on a poultry farm in the Thies region about 120 mi [about 193 km] south, resulting in the culling of about 100 000 chickens. It is not clear if the 2 outbreaks are linked.--communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[HPAI viruses emerged in western Africa in 2006 and reemerged in 2015. No outbreaks of HPAI had been reported in Senegal until very recently (end of 2020; ProMED archive number 20210108.8085504), when an outbreak in a poultry farm due to H5N1 was documented 200 km (about 124 mi) south of Djoudj bird sanctuary.

To 25 Jan 2021, this year there have been 93 wild bird cases of 844 in total since October [2020], of which 38 were reported to OIE on 22 Jan. At this stage in the 2016/17 epizootic, there had been 625 wild bird cases, with cases rising to over 1000 by mid-February 2017 in the 2nd peak. For poultry, overall, the number of outbreaks reported are reducing (particularly in Germany and Poland). The exception is France, which has reported a large increase in numbers as H5N8 spreads though the duck industry in the southwest. In southeast Europe, HPAI has not obviously spread, with a few wild bird cases on the Black Sea in Romania and the Czech Republic and no further reports in Hungary."" The full report is available at <tinyurl.com/3hroaud4>.The fact that HPAI subtype H5N8 and other subtypes HPAI H5N5, H5N4, N5N3 and H5N1 currently circulating in the European continent have been detected in wild birds is indicative that these viruses are being distributed wherever these wild birds migrate. Poultry producers, small and large alike, must therefore implement all the biosecurity measures necessary to protect their flocks from exposure and infection. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED maps:Puglia, Apulia, Italy: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8148832,16580Ilfov, Romania: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8148832,68118Normandy, France: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8148832,68119Northern Ireland, United Kingdom: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8148832,17415Bavaria, Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8148832,3744Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8148832,4181Lower Saxony, Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8148832,2856] See Also

Outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 re-emerged in eastern Asia in the last part of 2020. The high sequence homology recently observed with isolates in Europe during the winter season 2019-2020 suggests that the variants currently causing outbreaks in Asia came from Europe, perhaps via bird migration. With regards to HPAI H5N1, the Indian Subcontinent has experienced outbreaks in domestic poultry and other birds almost every year since the 1st report in 2006. Since November 2016, also subtype H5N8 outbreaks were reported in India, Pakistan, and Nepal. - Mod.PMB] See Also

Since then, a new wave of epizootic outbreaks of H5N8 have been continuously reported in several European countries, especially in wild birds, but also in poultry starting from mid-October 2020.The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1 HPAI virus, which were also reported by countries. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. Reports of increased numbers of outbreaks in wild birds indicate periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season. Consequently, improving on-farm biosecurity measures is a priority to reduce the likelihood of exposure to poultry.""

Cold, short winter days also increase the risk of avian influenza due to increased virus survival times in the environment"".

He developed mild symptoms on [28 Dec 2020] and was admitted to a hospital on [29 Dec 2020]. As of [4 Jan 2021], no family cluster was reported. This is the 1st case to be reported from China in 2021.In addition, 6 new cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus were reported on [9 Dec 2020].The cases were retrospectively detected through influenza-like illness surveillance (ILI) between July 2019 and December 2020. No deaths were reported among the reported cases and all 6 reported mild symptoms. 5 of the cases had exposure to poultry and one case had no clear poultry exposure. No family clusters were reported from any of the 6 cases.In 2020, there were 13 cases reported from China. A total of 42 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015.--Communicated by:ProMED<promed@promedmail.org>[The WHO weekly avian influenza update no 774 further notes:""Additionally, on [9 Dec 2020], 6 new cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus were reported in the Western Pacific Region. The cases were retrospectively detected through influenza-like illness surveillance (ILI) between July 2019 and December 2020. No deaths were reported among the reported cases and all 6 reported mild symptoms. 5 of the cases had exposure to poultry and one case had no clear poultry exposure.

(https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20210108.pdf).""H9N2 avian influenza viruses have become globally widespread in poultry over the last 2 decades and represent a genuine threat both to the global poultry industry but also humans through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. H9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years.""Studies have reported how ""reassortants between H9N2 viruses and human seasonal influenza viruses are able to efficiently transmit between ferrets and there is, therefore, a real danger eventually such a reassortant could emerge in the field.""""Several H9N2 viruses have human receptor binding, pH stable HA proteins that could potentially allow efficient transmission between humans whilst other H9N2 viruses contain internal gene cassettes that allow extremely efficient replication in humans (i.e., genotype 57). Overall there is a clear risk of both intersubtypic H9N2/human influenza virus reassortant emergence as well as an intrasubtyptic human binding HA/efficient mammalian polymerase reassortant emergence, either of which could potentially pose a high zoonotic and pandemic threat.""

The high sequence homology with isolates in Europe during the winter season 2019-2020 suggests that the variants currently causing outbreaks in Asia came from Europe, perhaps via bird migration. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of Hong Kong: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8113830,198] See Also

This is potentially due to their social nature, flocking, and feeding in close association with each other making it easy for the disease to be passed from bird to bird.In 2020, 127 pine siskins were admitted, which is a 13-fold increase from what we saw in the last 2 years. In December [2020] alone, 75 pine siskins were admitted and suspected to be infected with _Salmonella_.Since the New Year began [2121], 36 pine siskins suspected of _Salmonella_ poisoning have been brought in, and more are coming in every day.Salmonellosis is primarily transmitted by fecal contamination of food and water by sick birds, although it can also be transmitted through bird-to-bird contact. High traffic spots, such as bird feeders, create a source point of transmission and can exacerbate the spread of this deadly disease. Removing the feeders completely is the best solution to encourage birds to disperse, thereby minimizing the potential for infection. If you choose to keep your feeders up, they must be properly maintained to foster a healthy bird environment.--Communicated by: ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It would be important to know which strain of _Salmonella_ is implicated, as that determines its zoonotic potential or the risk to domestic animals. A common _Salmonella_ isolated from passerine birds is _S. enterica_ serovar Typhimurium which can cause diarrhea in humans and livestock.Being gregarious, siskins are particularly susceptible to contagion.

The 1st HPAI epidemic season started on 31 Dec 2019, with the 1st outbreak in poultry confirmed in Poland. A new HPAI virus of subtype H5N8 (2020) was involved in the outbreak. By March [2020], the disease was confirmed in Poland, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania. The H5N8 (2020) subtype of the HPAI virus was responsible for all of these outbreaks. The most affected Member State was Hungary, after the virus entered in the area with a high density of duck and geese holdings. Outbreaks of HPAI were also detected in Bulgaria between March and June 2020, but the virus involved was of subtype H5N8, which also circulated in Bulgaria in 2018-2019. The last outbreak in poultry related to the 1st epidemic season of HPAI was confirmed on 5 Jun 2020.""Only 3 wild birds were found infected with HPAI during the 1st half of 2020 (in Germany and Poland). The virus involved was the same as the one detected in the poultry farms.""The 2nd HPAI epidemic season started at the end of October 2020 when the 1st cases were reported in wild birds in the Netherlands. Again, the 1st HPAI virus detected was of H5N8 subtype, different from the one that circulated in the 1st half of the year [2020]. Since then and until the end of 2020, a high number of dead and sick wild birds, mostly of migratory species, were found to be infected with HPAI viruses of subtypes H5N8, H5N5, H5N1, and H5N3 being detected by several EU countries and the United Kingdom. The largest number of cases in wild birds were reported in the northern part of Germany, in Denmark, and in the Netherlands. Between October and end of December 2020, the disease was also confirmed in poultry in Croatia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.""See the map with the distribution of the HPAI detected during 2020, separated by epidemic season [at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_hapai_chrono_2020_map.pdf].HPAI- Latest developments 2021""The HPAI epidemic season, which started in October 2020, will continue in 2021.

HPAI subtype H5N1 is endemic in some countries of the African continent.The following information comes from a scientific article titled ""Evolution of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Poultry, Togo, 2018,"" published December 2019 in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal by the CDC:""In 2015, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses reemerged in poultry in West Africa. We describe the introduction of a reassortant clade 2.3.2.1c virus into Togo in April 2018. Our findings signal further local spread and evolution of these viruses, which could affect animal and human health.""Relatively little is known about the emergence, prevalence, and circulation of animal influenza viruses in Africa. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.2 viruses emerged in Africa in 2006 (cases were reported from Egypt, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, Togo, Ghana, Sudan, Djibouti, and Cameroon), although the virus was only maintained long term in Egypt. We conducted surveillance in domestic poultry in Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, and Togo during 2008-2010 but were unable to find virologic or serologic evidence for influenza A virus circulation. Several factors, such as type of hosts, climate, and animal density, might have provided unfavorable conditions for the virus' circulation in the region.""In early 2015, HPAI H5N1 viruses of clade 2.3.2.1c were reported in Nigeria, followed closely by detections in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Cameroon, and Togo. These viruses could be clustered into 2 genetic subgroups; cluster WA1 viruses were detected in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Niger, and cluster WA2 viruses were detected in Niger, Cote d'Ivoire, and Nigeria. In this study, we aimed to determine the origin and evolution of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses responsible for poultry outbreaks in Togo in April 2018 in the context of viruses from surrounding countries.""Reference:Fusade-Boyer M, Pato PS, Komlan M, et al.

Their carcasses have been sent to different laboratories to determine the cause of death.""The death of birds could be attributed to bird flu. We are expecting to get results by Tuesday evening [5 Jan 2020]. As a protocol, we have imposed prohibitory orders,"" she said.The local administration has already sounded an alert by banning all human activities within a 10-km [6.2-mi] radius of the Pong wetlands in Kangra district.The bird flu can spread to human beings and turn fatal.Besides the bar-headed goose, the other species were the shoveler, the river tern, the black-headed gull, and the common teal.Some birds -- including the bar-headed goose -- were seen acting strangely before their deaths, she said. ""When you're seeing that birds are not able to take the flight despite healthy wings, it's really disturbing. At some distance, you find their carcasses,"" she said.The bird carcasses were sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly, the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Jalandhar, and the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun to know their cause of death.The Rajasthan government last week [week of 28 Dec 2020] sounded an alert after confirmation of avian influenza in crows that died in Jhalawar district. Indore in Madhya Pradesh has also reported the death of crows.The mass mortality of poultry birds was reported at one of the largest poultry belt at Barwala near Panchkula in Haryana.According to the Bird Count India, a partnership comprising organizations and groups, over the past 7-10 days there have been reports of wild birds dying in separate incidents at different locations in the country.That wild bird die-off is not necessarily worrying. But it is possible that some of these recent deaths are out of the ordinary, with large numbers dying or reports of diagnoses of H5N1 (avian influenza).At the moment, no-one knows whether these are causes of larger concern, but it is worth keeping an eye on the situation. ""If you encounter a wild bird that is dead or dying, do not approach it, and under any circumstances do not touch it given the possibility (however small) that it might be infected with avian influenza. H5N1 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe illness in people,"" it warned.Sensing the gravity of the situation, Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) scientist KS Gopi Sundar told IANS that it's something an alarming situation.""We are getting reports of the deaths of birds in nature across India. It's likely to be a disease because the deaths are occurring in multiple locations involving multiple species. It is a dangerous situation and needs multi-stakeholder intervention on priority,"" he said.At the Pong wetlands, preliminary findings of their post mortem have ruled out poisoning as the cause of their death, wildlife officials said.Every winter, the Pong wetlands are home to over 100 000 birds of nearly 114 species. Among them the bar-headed goose, the northern pintail, the Eurasian coot, the common teal, the common pochard, the northern shoveler, the great cormorant, the Eurasian wigeon, and the ruddy shelduck are notable.According to the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), the Pong wetlands are the one wintering grounds in the globe to hold such a large congregation of bar-headed geese.Most of the wetlands in India have been regularly getting bar-headed geese every winter. But Pong is the only habitat that holds the largest influx of bar-headed geese every winter, a BNHS ornithologist told IANS.[Byline: Anthony Janzen]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Bar-headed geese (_Anser indicus_) breed in central Asia in colonies of thousands (see picture at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_goose#/media/File:Bar-headed_geese.jpg.). On 30 Apr 2005, an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza was detected in a large group of this species in Qinghai lake in western China. The diseased geese showed paralysis, unusual head tilt, staggering, and neck thrill. About 3000 geese died. Brown-headed and black-headed gulls and cormorants also died in that episode. Qinghai lake is a major stop-over of the Central Asian Flyway. Bar-headed geese and other wildfowl migrate south to winter as far south as India. - Mod.PMBMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8072963,304] See Also

The fact that HPAI subtypes H5N8, H5N5, H5N3, and H5N1 currently circulating in the European continent have been detected in wild birds is very indicative that these viruses are being distributed wherever these wild birds migrate.

Since then, a new wave of epizootic outbreaks of H5N8 [has] been continuously reported in several European countries especially in wild birds, but also in poultry starting from mid-October [2020]. The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1 HPAI virus, which were also reported by countries. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17. A few Asian countries also reported HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in poultry and/or wild birds. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. Report of increased number of outbreaks in wild birds [indicates] periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season. Consequently, improving on-farm biosecurity measures is a priority to reduce the likelihood of exposure to poultry.""

It is believed the patient contracted the disease at a live poultry trading market in Ningyuan County.This is the 26th human H5N6 avian flu infection reported since 2014.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[With continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected.Even though there is no confirmation of the disease in poultry, other people with possible contact should be traced and followed up as well as those in contact with the human case to rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission.As per the IHR (2005) decision instrument for the assessment and notification of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern, a case of human influenza caused by a new subtype is unusual or unexpected and may have serious public health impacts, and thus shall be notified to WHO (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241580496). - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map:Hunan Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8043141,341] See Also

A 6-mile (10 km) control zone has been set up on the island of Sanday. Thirty-nine free-range laying chickens died of bird flu, and the 11 remaining birds in the affected flock were put down.The controls include restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure, and restrictions on bird gatherings.Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said the risk to human health from the H5N8 Avian Influenza was very low.Bird keepers have been urged to comply with an order to house birds that came into effect on 14 Dec 2020.The last case of the H5N8 strain was found in a dead peregrine falcon in Dumfries and Galloway 4 years ago. Other less serious strains have been detected since then.Ms Voas said, ""We have already made clear that all bird keepers -- whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds -- must ensure that their biosecurity is up to scratch to protect their birds from disease and prevent any contact between their birds and wild birds.""Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flocks should seek veterinary advice immediately. Your private vet or local Animal and Plant Health Agency office will also be able to provide practical advice on keeping your birds safe from infection.""Any dead wild swans, geese, ducks, or gulls; falcons or other birds of prey; or 5 or more dead wild birds of other species in the same location should be reported to the Defra dead wild bird helpline.""She added that avian influenzas pose a very low food-safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs.Because of the number of cases in Europe and in England, the risk of bird flu is currently judged to be very high for wild birds, high for poultry where there is poor biosecurity, and medium for poultry with protection measures in place.A number of swans were recently found dead near the Hampshire coast and on the Isle of Wight, and there were culls in Warwickshire and Worcestershire.Earlier cases have included 2 farms in Norfolk, East Anglia, and a wildlife centre in Gloucestershire. All 10 500 turkeys at a farm in North Yorkshire were culled following an outbreak.Rural Affairs Minister Mairi Gougeon said Scottish cases were not ""unexpected"" given the cases in wild and captive birds elsewhere in the UK. ""We ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds,"" she added.NFU Scotland animal health policy manager Penny Middleton described it as ""disappointing.""""It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers, whether they have one hen in the back garden or a large poultry business, to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures to limit the spread of avian influenza and keep out the disease,"" she said. ""It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease -- both in domestic birds and in wild birds -- at the earliest opportunity.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A statement confirming the identity of the casual pathogen has been published on 18 Dec 2020 by the local Orcadian, citing an official announcement: ""A flock of birds from a farm on Sanday has tested positive for H5N8 avian influenza. In order to limit the further spread of disease, appropriate restrictions have been imposed on the premises and any identified contact premises"" (https://www.orcadian.co.uk/bird-flu-confirmed-in-orkney/). - Mod.AS]******[2] HPAI H5N8, poultry and captive birds, Derbyshire, EnglandDate: Tue 15 Dec 2020Source: FarmingUK [edited]https://www.farminguk.com/news/bird-flu-outbreak-in-poultry-at-premises-in-derbyshire_57203.htmlThe UK has recorded a 2nd outbreak of bird flu in a matter of days, after Defra today [Tue 15 Dec 2020] confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry and captive birds at a premises in Derbyshire. Avian influenza, of the H5N8 subtype, has today (15 Dec 2020) been confirmed at a premises near Willington, Derbyshire. A 3 km [1.9 mi] protection zone and a 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone have been put in place around to limit the risk of the disease spreading, Defra said.It comes after highly pathogenic bird flu was confirmed in captive birds at a non-poultry premises in Worcestershire on Sunday [13 Dec 2020].The news comes as mandatory housing measures were rolled out across the UK from yesterday [Mon 14 Dec 2020].It is now a legal requirement for all farmers and poultry keepers to keep their birds indoors following a string of outbreaks. They will need to follow strict biosecurity measures to limit the spread of avian influenza and eradicate the disease.The risk of incursion of bird flu is ""very high"" for wild birds, ""medium"" for poultry with high biosecurity, and ""high"" for poultry with poor biosecurity.A joint statement from Britain's 3 chief veterinary officers (CVOs) said, ""Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, from 14 Dec 2020 onwards, you will be legally required to keep your birds indoors. We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.""Just last week, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza were confirmed at 2 turkey farms in Norfolk.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Since late November 2020, HPAI H5N8 has been reported to affect poultry and/or captive non-poultry birds as well as wild birds in numerous European countries. This includes France, Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Slovenia, Croatia, and Poland. HPAI H5N8 has also been repeatedly reported from Israel, situated on main flyways of wild birds, migrating in the autumn months from their nesting grounds in Europe and Asia and to the wintering grounds in Africa.Subscribers are referred to Mod.CRD's commentary in 20201214.8018047. The abstract of an overview paper, cited in the said commentary, follows:""Between 15 Aug and 7 Dec 2020, 561 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections were reported in 15 EU/EEA countries and UK in wild birds, poultry, and captive birds, with Germany (n=370), Denmark (n=65), and the Netherlands (n=57) being the most affected countries. The majority of the detections have been reported in wild birds (n=510), primarily in barnacle goose, greylag goose, and Eurasian wigeon. Raptors have also been detected infected, particularly common buzzard. The majority of the birds had been found dead or moribund; however, there are also reports of HPAI virus infection in apparently healthy ducks or geese.A total of 43 HPAI outbreaks were notified in poultry, with signs of avian influenza infection being observed in at least 33 outbreaks; the most likely source of infection was indirect contact with wild birds. A total of 3 HPAI virus subtypes, A(H5N8) (n=518), A(H5N5) (n=17), and A(H5N1) (n=6), and 4 different genotypes were identified, suggesting the occurrence of multiple virus introductions into Europe. The reassortant A(H5N1) virus identified in EU/EEA countries has acquired gene segments from low-pathogenic viruses and is not related to A(H5N1) viruses of e.g., clade 2.3.2.1c causing human infections outside of Europe.As the autumn migration of wild waterbirds to their wintering areas in Europe continues, and given the expected local movements of these birds, there is still a high risk of introduction and further spread of HPAI A(H5) viruses within Europe. The risk of virus spread from wild birds to poultry is high, and Member States should enforce in ""high risk areas"" of their territories the measures provided for in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1136. Detection of outbreaks in breeder farms in Denmark, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom highlight also the risk of introduction via contaminated materials (bedding/straw) and equipment. Maintaining high and sustainable surveillance and biosecurity, particularly in high-risk areas, is of utmost importance. Two human cases due to zoonotic A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) avian influenza virus infection were reported during the reporting period. The risk for the general population as well as travel-related imported human cases are assessed as very low.""Subscribers are encouraged to visit the full report; its citation follows:EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control), EURL (European Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza), Adlhoch C, Fusaro A, Gonzales JL, Kuiken T, Marangon S, Niqueux E, Staubach C, Terregino C, and Baldinelli F.

The Department of Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) has also said a case has been reported in the past week [7-13 Dec 2020] in a little grebe, a type of water bird, in Carmarthenshire.Nearly 150 cases have been reported across the UK since the beginning of November [2020], prompting advice to the general public and bird owners. One of the largest outbreaks was reported this week at a wild bird rescue centre near Droitwich Spa in Worcestershire on 13 Dec 2020. All birds on the premises had to be humanely culled.The risk level has been increased to ""very high"" for wild birds and ""medium"" level for poultry. Anyone who sees a dead bird is asked not to touch it -- and if you see a dead or visibly sick bird, particularly swans, geese, ducks, gulls or birds of prey, they should be reported to Defra through 03459 335577.Anyone who keeps birds must now keep them inside, as new rules are in place due to the increased number of cases across both England and Wales. Bird keepers must also follow strict biosecurity measures. The rules have been tightened after Defra issued a warning in November [2020] about bird flu potentially being on the rise.The risk to public health is said to be very low, and the Food Standards Agency said that on the basis of current scientific evidence it posed a very low safety risk for UK consumers. Defra has also pointed out that avian flu is not linked to coronavirus.[Byline: Cathy Owen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Currently, HPAI viruses appear to be propagating quickly in Europe. During the epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus in Europe in 2016-2017, HPAI viruses of subtype H5N5 were also isolated, although in a more limited number. Experiments in primary chicken and duck cells revealed only minor differences in cytopathogenicity and replication kinetics between H5N5 genotypes and H5N8. Results of a recent study by Bergervoet et al. (1) led to the conclusion that the limited spread and the differences in geographical distribution of HPAI H5N5 viruses compared with H5N8 are related to the timing of the reassortment events and introduction into Europe rather than changes in virus pathogenicity or replication kinetics. However, a similar scenario is observed this year (2020), so other explanations might be operating. - Mod.PMBReference1. Bergervoet SA, Ho CKY, Heutink R, et al. Spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N5 viruses in Europe in 2016-2017 appears related to the timing of reassortment events.

It marks the 3rd highly pathogenic AI case reported at a poultry house this year [2020] and the 1st such case confirmed in South Jeolla Province in 3 years.Having blocked access to the affected farm and culled its ducks, local authorities plan to cull nearly 500 000 ducks and chickens in 10 nearby farms within a 3-km radius as a precautionary measure, the regional government said.The municipality also designated the areas within a 10-km radius of the infected farm, which house 44 duck and chicken farms, as a special zone subject to heightened quarantine.Movement of poultry to and from poultry farms in South Jeolla province has also been prohibited for 30 days.Local quarantine authorities launched an epidemiological investigation into the affected area to trace the source of the latest AI case.""The initial infection source (of the latest case) has yet to be found, as no report of suspected infection or symptoms has been filed by other farms in nearby areas,"" an official at the regional government said. ""We elevated the quarantine level to the highest to curb the spread.""Since South Korea recorded the 1st outbreak of highly pathogenic AI in 32 months in late October 2020 in Cheonan, 92 km south of Seoul, more than 10 cases have been additionally confirmed, putting quarantine authorities on high alert against potential mass outbreaks.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[The above outbreak in ducks was notified to the OIE in follow-up report No. 1, submitted on 5 Dec 2020 (outbreak No. 2 in the report, which addresses also another, distant outbreak in poultry).

She was hospitalized and subsequently passed away on [27 Nov 2020].From 2014 to date, 25 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Chinese health authorities.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks.The clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Fri 11 Dec 2020 21:46 HKTSource: RTHK [in Chinese, trans., edited]https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1564874-20201211.htmThe Centre for Health Protection is closely monitoring a new case of human infection with avian influenza [AI] H5N6 in the Mainland. The patient was an 81-year-old female farmer in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province. Before she developed symptoms on [16 Nov 2020], she had contact with live chickens at home and died on [27 Nov 2020] after admission.The spokesperson said that since 2014, the Mainland health authorities have reported a total of 25 cases of human infection with avian influenza H5N6, reminding the public to avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets, or farms if they go to the Mainland or other affected areas. If you return to Hong Kong from the affected area, you should seek medical advice immediately if you develop symptoms.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[China's 1st H5N6 strain was isolated in March 2014 from a domestic duck in Guangdong Province. Since then, the H5 subtype has gradually become the main cause of the sporadic AIV infections in poultry in southern China. To date, a total of 24 laboratory-confirmed cases (excluding the case above) of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 7 deaths at the time of the IHR (International Health Regulations) report, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20201204.pdf)Epidemiological investigations have confirmed that most cases of H5N6 human infection had contact with infected poultry. Live poultry markets (LPMs) and backyard poultry flocks (BPFs) are 2 major risk factors for human infections. It had also been noticed that in many provinces, human infections of AIVs decreased gradually after closing LPMs.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected.With continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.Surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of the viruses.

The majority of the detections have been reported in wild birds (n=510), primarily in barnacle goose, greylag goose, and Eurasian wigeon. Raptors have also been detected infected, particularly common buzzard. The majority of the birds had been found dead or moribund, however, there are also reports of HPAI virus infection in apparently healthy ducks or geese. A total of 43 HPAI outbreaks were notified in poultry; with signs of avian influenza infection being observed in at least 33 outbreaks; the most likely source of infection was indirect contact with wild birds. A total of 3 HPAI virus subtypes, A(H5N8) (n=518), A(H5N5) (n=17) and A(H5N1) (n=6), and 4 different genotypes were identified, suggesting the occurrence of multiple virus introductions into Europe. The reassortant A(H5N1) virus identified in EU/EEA countries has acquired gene segments from low pathogenic viruses and is not related to A(H5N1) viruses of e.g. clade 2.3.2.1c causing human infections outside of Europe. As the autumn migration of wild waterbirds to their wintering areas in Europe continues, and given the expected local movements of these birds, there is still a high risk of introduction and further spread of HPAI A(H5) viruses within Europe. The risk of virus spread from wild birds to poultry is high and Member States should enforce in 'high risk areas' of their territories the measures provided for in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1136. Detection of outbreaks in breeder farms in Denmark, the Netherlands and United Kingdom, highlight also the risk of introduction via contaminated materials (bedding/straw) and equipment. Maintaining high and sustainable surveillance and biosecurity, particularly in high-risk areas is of utmost importance. Two human cases due to zoonotic A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) avian influenza virus infection were reported during the reporting period. The risk for the general population as well as travel-related imported human cases are assessed as very low"".ReferenceEuropean Food Safety Authority, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and European Union Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza.

It probably concerns low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). There are no other poultry farms within the 1-km (0.63 mi) zone of this farm. To prevent the virus from spreading, the farm is culled by the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). In total, this concerns approximately 25 000 animals.Low pathogenic bird flu is less infectious than highly pathogenic bird flu. However, the serotypes H5 and H7 of low pathogenic avian influenza can mutate into a highly pathogenic virus. Therefore, strict measures must be taken.In the 10-km (6.2 mi) zone around this farm the transport ban applies. This ban covers poultry, eggs, poultry manure and used bedding, as well as other animals and certain products from commercial poultry companies"".

The affected population was wild birds. See event summary and map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=22407Wild birds can normally carry avian influenza viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts but they do not commonly get sick. They have historically been known as reservoirs and vectors of AI viruses. Around the world, surveillance measures have been put in place to monitor occurrence and characteristics of AI viruses in wild birds. Avian influenza viruses do not cause disease in wild birds, but it is very likely that wild birds might spread the virus via their migratory flyways. National authorities are strongly encouraged to raise awareness and establish cooperation mechanisms with hunters and other individuals who may come into contact with wild birds in order to provide early information on sick or dead wild birds.Source: OIE Avian Influenza Portal https://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza/. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map of China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8003821,67930] See Also

""In Europe, the 1st outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 were reported in August 2020 in Russia in both poultry and wild birds. Since then, a new wave of outbreaks of H5N8 have been continuously reported in several of the European countries especially in wild birds but also in poultry starting from mid-October. The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1 HPAI virus, which were also reported by countries. A few Asian countries also reported HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in poultry and/or wild birds. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. Report of increased number of outbreaks in wild birds indicate periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season.

In view of the numerous cases of infections in wild birds in Europe, they should be considered as the most likely vector for the introduction of the virus into Poland. The results of the studies also indicate that the current situation is unrelated to the HPAI H5N8 epidemic in Europe in the 2019/2020 season.See the information (in Polish) at https://tinyurl.com/y3k7t55j. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map of Poland: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7991285,64624] See Also

This new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant was originally detected in poultry in Iraq in May 2020 with subsequent detections in Russia and Kazakhstan. It seems likely that migratory waterfowl played a key role in the incursion of this virus into Europe with over 500 detections in wild birds and spillover events into commercial poultry and captive birds.This situation report provides an overview of the virological, epidemiological, and ornithological characteristics of this new epizootic, which involves H5N8, H5N5 and H5N1 subtypes suggesting local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. We describe the geographical distribution and the variety of avian hosts demonstrating susceptibility to this emerging virus.The 582 detections of HPAI H5 comprise 35 detections in poultry (6%), 8 in captive birds (1%) and 539 wild bird events (93%). Previous epizootics in Europe have had varied clinical and epidemiological presentations; the 2016/17 H5N8 epizootic affected both wild birds and poultry with over 2800 events recorded between October 2016 and July 2017. The H5N6 epizootic in 2017/18 primarily affected wild birds (80 events) with only 7 events in poultry and captive flocks.--Communicated by:Adam BrouwerAnimal and Plant Health Agency - OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian InfluenzaAPHA-Weybridge, UK<adam.brouwer@apha.gov.uk>[The authors of the above useful APHA situation report are Adam Brouwer, Nicola Lewis, Elliot Whittard, David Stroud, Ashley Banyard, Rowena Hansen, and Ian Brown. We are indebted to the submitter and his peers.The following section, excerpted from the above-cited report, deserves inclusion:H5 HPAI (2.3.4.4b of putative African origin for some gene segments) was present in European poultry from 2 Jan 2020 to the last detection on 4 Jun 2020, with H5N8 detected in Eastern Europe with extensive spread within poultry in Hungary (276 events) and Poland (35 events).There were 6 detections in wild birds of a closely related virus to the poultry-associated H5N8 between Jan and Mar 2020 suggesting a relatively low incidence in wild birds.Iraq reported H5N8 in poultry in May 2020 with a new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant genetically distinct from the previous 2020 strains in Europe. Genetically similar H5N8 viruses were subsequently detected in southern central Russia, northern Kazakhstan and south-western Russia. In western Europe, HPAI H5 in wild birds was suspected when there was an initial detection in Eurasian wigeons in the Netherlands on 16 Oct 2020 with disease confirmed on 27 Oct with one bird positive for H5N8 and 4 positive for H5N1. The H5N8 virus was similar to that reported in Russia, Kazakhstan and Iraq whilst the H5N1 characterisation suggested local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. Detections in poultry followed with initial H5N8 cases in the Netherlands and the UK submitted to national reference laboratories on 28 Oct and 2 Nov 2020, respectively. Subsequently there has been a substantial increase in cases (principally H5N8) in wild birds particularly in northern Europe and spillover events to commercial poultry and captive birds involving reports from 14 European countries to date [28 Nov 2020].Nearly all detections of HPAI H5 in wild birds have been found close to coastlines with significant clusters of cases in the Jutland peninsula and within the extensive Wadden Sea -- a continuous intertidal wetland stretching from Denmark to the Netherlands and where many of the Danish, German and Dutch cases occurred. However, wild bird cases also occurred in inland areas in those and other countries, with a 2nd cluster of wild bird detections in the Netherlands.The lack of detections in other countries in Northern Europe does not imply that HPAIv is absent -- rather that a combination of varied disease prevalence and the sensitivity of wild bird surveillance programmes has inhibited detection thus far.---The report includes a table presenting details of the 582 reported HPAI H5 disease events in Europe, 27 Oct - 28 Nov 2020, for the 14 addressed European countries. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:Europe: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7988670,6010] See Also

As such, to prevent avian influenza (AI), MAFRA will strengthen quarantine measures such as disinfection of migratory bird sites and urged poultry farms to comply with quarantine rules.... It is urged for poultry farms nationwide to strictly adhere to quarantine rules such as blocking access to visitors and vehicles, installing nets to block wild birds and rodents, applying quicklime around the access road to farmhouses and livestock facilities, disinfecting and wearing dedicated boots before entering the livestock facilities, cleaning and disinfecting before work. In particular, during the Chuseok holiday period, it is emphasized that visitors are restricted from entering poultry breeding facilities and that farms are urged to strictly comply with the prohibition of visiting migratory birds.""See the complete information at https://tinyurl.com/yytlo6lz. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:North Jeolla Province, South Korea: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7986533,6602] See Also

Since 11 Nov 2020, and given the epidemiological situation in Europe, it was decided not to allow competent authorities to make exceptions to the measures to be applied in this kind of area. These measures are: a) Using birds of Anseriformes and Charadriiformes Orders as decoys is prohibited. (b) Breeding ducks and geese with other species of poultry is prohibited. (c) Rearing free-range poultry is prohibited. (d) Giving poultry water from water reservoirs accessible to wild birds is prohibited, unless water can be treated to ensure inactivation of possible avian influenza viruses. (e) Outdoor water reservoirs required for poultry welfare will be sufficiently protected against wild waterfowl. f) Poultry or other captive birds are prohibited in animal assembly centers defined in Article 3.7 of Law 8/2003 of 24 Apr 2020 on animal health, including livestock shows, exhibitions and cultural celebrations, as well as any concentration of poultry or other captive birds outdoors.

Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.[The location of the outbreaks can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[""Several factors can contribute to the spread of avian influenza (AI) viruses, such as: globalisation and international trade; farming and sale (live bird markets); wild birds and migratory routes.Wild birds can normally carry AI viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts, but they do not commonly get sick, which allow them to carry the viruses long distances along their migration flyways.Wild birds, as natural hosts and reservoirs for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species.The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year.Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decreasing the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans;"" Source: https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza/.The following abstract comes from a scientific article titled ""Enterotropism of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N8 from the 2016/2017 epidemic in some wild bird species,"" which is available in ref. 1:Abstract:""In 2016/2017, H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the Goose/Guangdong lineage spread from Asia to Europe, causing the biggest and most widespread HPAI epidemic on record in wild and domestic birds in Europe. We hypothesized that the wide dissemination of the 2016 H5N8 virus resulted at least partly from a change in tissue tropism from the respiratory tract, as in older HPAIV viruses, to the intestinal tract, as in low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, allowing more efficient faecal-oral transmission. Therefore, we determined the tissue tropism and associated lesions in wild birds found dead during the 2016 H5N8 epidemic, as well as the pattern of attachment of 2016 H5N8 virus to respiratory and intestinal tissues of four key wild duck species. We found that, out of 39 H5N8-infected wild birds of 12 species, four species expressed virus antigen in both respiratory and intestinal epithelium, one species only in respiratory epithelium, and one species only in intestinal epithelium. Virus antigen expression was association with inflammation and necrosis in multiple tissues. The level of attachment to wild duck intestinal epithelia of 2016 H5N8 virus was comparable to that of LPAI H4N5 virus, and higher than that of 2005 H5N1 virus for 2 of the 4 duck species and chicken tested. Overall, these results indicate that 2016 H5N8 may have acquired a similar enterotropism to LPAI viruses, without having lost the respirotropism of older HPAI viruses of the Goose/Guangdong lineage. The increased enterotropism of 2016 H5N8 implies that this virus had an increased chance to persist long term in the wild waterbird reservoir.""Reference:1.

Last week [16-22 Nov 2020], officials from the RSPCA and the Department for Environmental and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) were called to Stanley Park lake in Blackpool.They were responding to reports from residents at the seaside resort who spotted the bodies of several swans. Concerned park goers theorised that the animals, whose bodies were also spotted on the lake bank and the island, could have been subject to attacks but it was later confirmed to be the result of a disease.Defra has now confirmed that 9 of the swans which had died at Stanley Park lake had tested positive for Avian Influenza H5N8. The 1st deceased swan was discovered at Stanley Park on [Sun 15 Nov 2020]. The RSPCA and DEFRA were both contacted that day.Public Health England has confirmed that the risk to public health is very low.The RSPCA have been in attendance at the park regularly since and DEFRA removed a number of swans for further investigation and analysis. It was confirmed to the council that a number of the swans tested were positive for Avian Influenza H5N8.We have been advised that the park can remain open to the public as the risk is very low, however, an area around the lake will be zoned off as a precaution.There have been a small number of cases of Avian Influenza also detected in other parts of England. There have been a number of confirmed reports of avian influenza in wild birds including geese and swans in the Netherlands and northern Germany in recent weeks. These wild birds are all on the waterfowl flyway from breeding grounds in western Russia, where the H5N8 strain was reported in poultry in mid-October [2020].[Byline: Rachel Howarth]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Currently, HPAI viruses appear to be propagating quickly in Europe, the subtype H5N8 belonging to clade 2.3.4.4 in particular. This subtype has been causing outbreaks in Asia, Europe and North America since 2014. Migratory wild birds have been implicated in the propagation of H5N8 (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6309/213) and domestic ducks play a major role in the maintenance of this subtype (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tbed.13406).

HPAI is highly contagious among birds and can spread rapidly throughout poultry flocks.A spokesman for DEFRA said: ""Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining strong biosecurity measures on their premises.""Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss added: ""It is important now more than ever that bird keepers ensure they are doing all they can to maintain and strengthen good biosecurity on their premises to ensure we prevent further outbreaks.""According to DEFRA, in addition to the 2 cases in Dorset, birds near Stroud in Gloucestershire, Dawlish in Devon, Ormskirk in Lancashire, Boston in Lincolnshire, Godmanchester in Cambridge and Rochford in Essex have tested positive for avian influenza H5N8.Public Health England (PHE) has advised that the risk to public health from the virus is very low, and the Food Standards Agency has advised that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.Dr. Gavin Dabrera, Consultant in Acute Respiratory Infections at PHE, said: ""To date, there have been no human cases of infection with influenza A (H5N8) confirmed by the World Health Organisation and the risk to public health is very low.""Our advice regarding contact with wild birds remains the same -- make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after coming into contact with any animal and do not touch any sick or dead birds.""[Byline: Josie Klein]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Currently, HPAI viruses appear to be propagating quickly in Europe, the subtype H5N8 belonging to clade 2.3.4.4 in particular. This subtype has been causing outbreaks in Asia, Europe and North America since 2014. Migratory wild birds have been implicated in the propagation of H5N8 (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf8852), and domestic ducks play a major role in the maintenance of this subtype (https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13406).

Since then, a new wave of outbreaks of H5N8 has been continuously reported in several of the European countries especially in wild birds but also in poultry starting from mid-October [2020]. The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1 HPAI virus, which were also reported by countries. A few Asian countries also reported HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in poultry and/or wild birds. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. Report of increased number of outbreaks in wild birds indicate periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season.

The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and respiratory secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.""To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must first be cleaned from the environment"".

As of 19 Nov [2002], 12 pm, 302 HPAI A(H5) detections have been reported, with the majority of the detections referring to wild birds (n = 281), and a few related to outbreaks in poultry (n = 18) and captive birds (n = 3). Most of the detections in wild birds were in wild waterbirds, being barnacle goose the most affected species (n = 110), followed by greylag goose (n = 47), Eurasian wigeon (n = 32), mallard (n = 14), and common buzzard (n = 13). Three HPAI virus subtypes were identified -- A(H5N8), A(H5N5) and A(H5N1) -- with A(H5N8) being the most reported subtype (n = 284). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viruses evolved from a single progenitor virus that went through multiple reassortment events. Based on the ongoing autumn migration of wild waterbirds to their wintering areas in Europe, there is a continued risk of further introduction of HPAI A(H5) viruses into Europe. Furthermore, given the expected movements of both migratory, and resident wild birds in Europe during winter, there is a high risk of further spread of HPAI A(H5) viruses within Europe. No genetic markers indicating adaptation to mammals have been identified in the viruses analysed so far, and no human infection due to avian influenza viruses detected in the recent outbreaks has been reported. For that reason, the risk to the general population remains very low. However, following the precautionary principle, people should avoid touching sick or dead birds unprotected to minimise any potential risk.Reference1.

The case is a one-year old female from Saravan province, who had exposure to domestic poultry. She developed cough, fever, and difficulty breathing on [13 Oct 2020]. On [16 Oct 2020], she was hospitalised and had her sample collected. She was discharged on [19 Oct 2020]. All household contacts tested negative for Influenza A.As of [5 Nov 2020], a total of 239 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus were reported from 4 countries within the Western Pacific Region since January 2003 (Table 1). Of these cases, 134 were fatal, resulting in a case fatality rate (CFR) of 56 percent. The last case was reported from Lao PDR, with an onset date of [13 Oct 2020] (one case, no death).Table 1 (available at the source URL above): Cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed human cases (C) and deaths (D) of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection reported to WHO, by date of onset (January 2003 to 5 Nov 2020), Western Pacific Region.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Influenza viruses are constantly changing and animal flu viruses can change such that they may gain the ability to infect easily and spread among people. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.Human infections with novel avian influenza virus like Asian H5N1 are concerning because of their pandemic potential.Globally, from January 2003 to 5 Nov 2020, there were 862 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus reported from 17 countries. Of these 862 cases, 455 were fatal (CFR of 53%). As of 5 Nov 2020, a total of 239 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus were reported from 4 countries within the Western Pacific Region (Cambodia, China, Laos, and Viet Nam) since January 2003. Of these cases, 134 were fatal, resulting in a case fatality rate (CFR) of 56%. The most recent case is the one reported above from Laos, with an onset date of 13 Oct 2020 (one case, no death) (https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/).With continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans. Surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of the viruses. -Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED map of Laos: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7939962,67857] See Also

A 3km [approx. 1.8 mi] Protection Zone and 10km [approx. 6.2 mi] surveillance zone have been put in place around the infected premises.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The conclusion of the last outbreak assessment report for the cases in both LPAI and HPAI in UK and Europe, published on 10 Nov 2020 by DEFRA-APHA, mentioned that:""As a consequence of the H5N8 HPAI poultry outbreak in the UK, and in Germany and the Netherlands; as well as the increasing HPAI H5N8 events in wild birds in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands and Germany this week, and the known migration routes on to the UK from these countries; the risk of HPAI incursion in wild birds in the UK is High. The overall risk of infection of poultry in the UK is Medium; although it should be noted that the risk of introduction to individual premises depends upon the level of biosecurity implemented on farm to prevent direct or indirect contact with wild birds. We recommend biosecurity measures should be maintained or strengthened, as required.""We strongly recommend that all poultry keepers (including backyard keepers) review their biosecurity measures and business continuity plans, as the risk has now increased. Keepers should familiarize themselves with government guidance on good biosecurity and how to report suspicion of disease appropriately"".

During and after the winter of 2016, a related, but genetically distinct influenza H5N8 virus was detected in Europe; in addition, reassortant influenza H5N5 and H5N6 viruses emerged. Because the influenza season progressed along the fall migratory routes for wild birds from Siberia across Asia into Europe, large numbers of dead wild birds and outbreaks in poultry flocks were associated with H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group B. Overall, 24 of the 31 European Union countries, neighboring countries, Israel, and countries in the Middle East were facing large avian influenza outbreaks in poultry or wild birds during that period. Since the end of 2019, HPAI H5N8 outbreaks have been reported in Europe in poultry and in captive and wild birds. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7931494,101] See Also

The samples were sent to the laboratory of the local veterinary service (Seibu Livestock Hygiene Service Centre; LHSC) and the samples collected from dead birds were positive for influenza A virus by antigen-capture kits. On 5 Nov 2020, the LHSC conducted RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5. On 6 Nov 2020, the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) conducted the sequencing test and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N8 and causative virus was determined as high pathogenicity avian influenza. Stamping-out policy applied to the affected farm. Destruction of all the susceptible birds in the affected farm is being implemented.

This same source describes that during the month of October, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was found in wild duck droppings in the city of Monbetsu, Hokkaido. Avian influenza H5N8 subtype was isolated on 24 Oct 2020 by Hokkaido University. (https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/11/08/national/bird-flu-shikoku-kagawa/).""Wild birds, as natural hosts and reservoirs for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds, however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species.""The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year. Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.""Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure, and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans"".Source: OIE Avian Influenza Portal https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map of Japan: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7928569,3534] See Also

A 3-km Protection Zone and a 10-km Surveillance Zone have been put in place around the infected site to limit the risk of the disease spreading.This case is unrelated to the H5N2 strain which was confirmed at a small commercial premises near Deal in Kent on Mon 2 Nov 2020 [see OIE report above. - Mod.CRD].Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low, and the Food Standards Agency advises that avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Netherlands has reported, since 17 Oct 2020, HPAI H5N8-infected mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) and a Eurasian Wigeon (_Mareca penelope_) found dead in 3 sites. This is the 1st outbreak of H5N8 HPAI officially reported in the Netherlands since the last detection of H5N8 HPAI in April 2017 in wild mallards; it is also the 1st HPAI outbreak in western Europe this season.The H5N8 HPAI introduction in the country is most likely related to wild bird migration.Germany reported a case in a wild bird on 30 Oct 2020 (20201103.7912764). The case involved a Eurasian Wigeon found ill in Hamburg, subsequently testing positive for HPAI and euthanized. Germany has been on high alert for HPAI since the beginning of October 2020 and increased surveillance efforts. There have been further outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 in Russia, including outbreaks in poultry in the west of the country on 27 Oct 2020 following previous outbreaks in poultry, and cases in wild water-birds in southern central Russia, along the border with Kazakhstan, and in northern Kazakhstan's poultry.The said and additional information is available in DEFRA's updated assessment of 30 Oct 2020 (Ref: VITT/1200 HPAI in Europe, at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/932205/hpai-netherlands-poa-201030.pdf). The assessment is a reminder that the Eurasian Wigeon is strongly migratory and is a common winter visitor to Great Britain.On 30 Sep 2020, ECDC (the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) published a warning on increased risk of HPAI introduction. The warning followed HPAI outbreaks among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan over the past few months. This region is a known autumn migration route for wild water birds heading to Europe.The warning indicated that northern and eastern Europe are very vulnerable to new outbreaks, given past experience. When HPAI was detected in the same area of Russia in the summers of 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in northern and eastern Europe: ""If the pattern is repeated this year [2020], HPAI is expected to arrive in the same areas of Europe in autumn or winter. Subsequent spread to countries in southern and western Europe is also possible."" The warning, urging EU states to step up surveillance and biosecurity measures to guard against possible new outbreaks of avian influenza this year [2020], is available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/avian-influenza-eu-alert-new-outbreaks.Subscribers are encouraged to visit the recent commentary by wildlife moderator PMB on the HPAI situation in Europe at https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7912764.The risk of transmission of avian influenza viruses to the general public in Europe remains very low. However, to minimize the risk of transmission to humans, people are advised not to not touch dead birds without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. - Mod.AS][Further information on these cases in the UK, including the restrictions and movement controls, can be seen at Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs' (DEFRA) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency's (APHA) ""Guidance on Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)"" website at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#latest-situation, (latest update 3 Nov 2020).""Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. There are some simple measures that all poultry keepers, whether they are running a large commercial farm, keeping a few hens in their back garden, or rearing game birds, should take to protect their birds against the threat of avian flu:""These include:- Keeping the area where birds live clean and tidy, controlling rats and mice and regularly cleansing and disinfecting any hard surfaces- Cleaning footwear before and after visits- Placing birds' feed and water in fully enclosed areas that are protected from wild birds, and removing any spilled feed regularly- Putting fencing around outdoor areas where birds are allowed and limiting their access to ponds or areas visited by wild waterfowl- Where possible, avoid keeping ducks and geese with other poultry species."" - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map:England, United Kingdom: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7913786,279] See Also

During and after the winter of 2016, a related, but genetically distinct influenza H5N8 virus was detected in Europe; in addition, reassortant influenza H5N5 and H5N6 viruses emerged. Because the influenza season progressed along the fall migratory routes for wild birds from Siberia across Asia into Europe, large numbers of dead wild birds and outbreaks in poultry flocks were associated with H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group B. Overall, 24 of the 31 the European Union countries, neighboring countries, Israel, and countries in the Middle East were facing large avian influenza outbreaks in poultry or wild birds during that period. Since the end of 2019 HPAI H5N8 outbreaks were reported in Europe in poultry, captive birds, and wild birds.Mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) have been naturally infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtypes H5N1 and H5N8, with similar pathological consequences. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7912764,3715] See Also

See the report at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review? page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=36235.The following 3 paragraphs are excerpted from the OIE Avian Influenza Portal (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza/):Wild birds, as natural host and reservoir for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seem to pass easily between different bird species.The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year. Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human virus components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans.---The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Report No. 16, from 2 to 22 Oct 2020, World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department, is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/HPAI_asof22102020.pdf. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:Gelderland Province, Netherlands: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7905813,10617] See Also

The sector is alarmed because this year's [2020] contamination is early and has entered a barn where high hygiene standards are maintained.""What is still to come?"" asks Hennie de Haan, chairman of the Dutch Poultry Farmers' Union (NVP). ""The bird migration, with which the virus spreads, has only just started. Moreover, this is a company where very careful work is done and the animals do not come outside. That it got in there anyway puzzles and worries us.""It is the 4th time in 7 winters that bird flu has been diagnosed in the Netherlands. It has never gotten as bad as in 2003, when the industry seemed doomed. Hundreds of poultry farms were affected and millions of animals had to be culled. As now, it concerned the serious, so-called highly pathogenic variant of bird flu; highly contagious and almost acutely lethal to poultry.Professor of farm animal health care Arjan Stegeman (Utrecht University) finds the concerns from the sector justified. ""A massive amplification of the virus is possible,"" he says. ""It is realistic to think that multiple infections will follow."" According to Stegeman, it is now important that poultry farmers pay extra attention to hygiene.He says it is plausible that faeces from wild water birds entered the stable in Altforst via, for example, a boot from the pasture. ""This can happen in the river area, where porters such as wigeons forage."" The infected animals are believed to have flown in from Russia, where outbreaks had already occurred.Although people are only sporadically infected by the variant of the current virus, employees of the company in Altforst are given a flu shot as a precaution. In 2003 the virus did spread to humans, but only to those involved who had worked very intensively around the infected animals. A Dutch vet died at the time from the effects of bird flu.The breeding plant in Altforst, with chickens and roosters for the production of hatching eggs for the meat industry, will be culled. There are no companies within a kilometer, so preventive clearing is not necessary. A transport ban applies to the 25 poultry farmers within a radius of 10 kilometers [6.2 mi] and they will be tested for bird flu within 3 kilometers [1.9 mi].""This outbreak will immediately have major economic consequences for our export position,"" says Gert-Jan Oplaat of the association of the Dutch poultry processing industry. ""Countries will lock their borders for us."" Products outside the closed zone may be officially exported, but according to Oplaat, ""there are always countries that say: the Netherlands is small, we don't get anything from there.""All commercial poultry farms had been obliged to keep chickens and other birds indoors for a week. This obligation followed the diagnosis of bird flu in 2 wild mute swans in the province of Utrecht.In addition to the commercial housing obligation, zoos, petting zoos, and owners of hobby birds are also obliged to screen their poultry and waterfowl to prevent these animals from coming into contact with wild waterfowl.Bird flu first appeared in China in 1996, after which it spread and subsequently was not effectively controlled in Southeast Asia. ""It gave the virus the chance to constantly switch to wild birds,"" says professor Stegeman. ""Eventually the virus adapted to wild waterfowl, which are hardly affected by it themselves.[Byline: Pieter Hotse Smit]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The major 2003 HPAI epizootic in the Netherlands mentioned in the media report above, which involved nearly 500 reported human infections (see archive 20051221.3649), was caused by HPAI H7N7.The official report of the current outbreak in Altforst (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/XwJe4gyKZxAV1F426) is yet to become available; most likely, it has been caused by the same virus strain, HPAI H5N8, discovered in 2 mute swans found dead on 17 Oct 2020 in a wetland in Kockengen (50 km/31 mi from Altforst, both in the Utrecht province, central Netherlands).

Recently HPAI viruses of the H5N8 subtype have caused outbreaks in the Russia Federation in July [2020] and in the Republic of Kazakhstan since September [2020]. Viruses detected in domestic ducks, geese, chickens and a single mute swan in the Republic of Kazakhstan in September 2020 were of the A/H5N8 subtype and had a multi-basic cleavage site motif consistent with a highly pathogenic phenotype in galliform birds (PLREKRRKRGLF) and belong to A/H5 GsGd clade 2.3.4.4b. For all gene segments the Kazakhstan viruses cluster together in phylogenetic trees, with the closest genetic relatives for a putative ancestral strain last detected in around 2017/2018. However long branch lengths from these putative ancestral relatives for each gene to current outbreak strains suggest undetected maintenance of Kazakhstan-like viruses as a complete genotype from emergence likely in early 2018 through to detection in September 2020. No subsequent information on the detection, circulation or spread of this emergent H5N8 virus is currently available, prior to the detection of the viruses in Kazakhstan. The viruses can be clearly distinguished in all gene segments from those of H5N8 viruses that caused widespread outbreaks in Europe during the first half of 2020. The phylogenetic tree topology, the lack of evidence for reassortment with LPAI gene segments from either domestic or wild anseriforms, the relatively short branch lengths within the Republic of Kazakhstan cluster linked by a long branch to ancestral strains suggests a) a very similar virus is responsible for all outbreaks in Kazakhstan, and b) long-term and under-surveilled but continued circulation is more likely to have occurred in galliform poultry in unknown regions/locations.The threat of this virus to the poultry sector through winter 2020/21 remains, along with the potential for re-spillover and diffusion mediated by wild birds; risk mitigation - proportional to previous years - is required.This work was done through close collaboration between the AI International Reference Laboratory, APHA-Weybridge, the Royal Veterinary College UK, Kazakh Scientific Research Veterinary Institute, Almaty and the National Veterinary Reference Centre, Nur-Sultan, Republic of Kazakhstan. --Professor Ian H. Brown, MIBiol PhDHead of Virology DepartmentDirector of OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle DiseaseOIE Reference Laboratory for Swine InfluenzaAnimal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)Weybridge, UK<Ian.Brown@apha.gov.uk>[Kazakhstan reported on 16 and 17 Sep 2020 outbreaks of HPAI H5 on its northern territories, affecting, respectively, wild birds (unidentified Anatidae and Corvidae) and poultry (species not given); both notifications were included in 20200919.7796269, which was accompanied by the following commentary by Mod. CRD: ""Since August 2020, Russia reported 39 outbreaks of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza]. All were associated with the H5 hemagglutinin subtype, but only 2 of the 39 have been fully characterized as H5N8. These outbreaks occurred in both domestic poultry and wild birds and were located in Omsk, Kurgan, Tyumen, and Chelyabinsk oblasts. These oblasts border the North Kazakhstan region.

Determining the subtype and strain of this virus is very important"". The current report from OIE/FAO International AI Reference Laboratory, for which Prof Brown and his colleagues are gratefully acknowledged, provides detailed information on the strain circulating in Kazakhstan. Complementary data of the H5 AI strain circulating on the Russian side of North Kazakhstan, compared to the Kazakh strain, will be helpful. Recently, HPAI outbreaks have been reported to the OIE from the Karachay-Cherkessia Republic in the North Caucasus region of Southern Russia (poultry, H5, 20201006.7840560) and from central Israel (poultry & wild, H5N8, 20201015.7864774, 20201014.7861465). Both are located on flyways of migrating birds from central/northern Asia.

During and after the winter of 2016, a related, but genetically distinct influenza H5N8 virus was detected in Europe; in addition, reassortant influenza H5N5 and H5N6 viruses emerged.Because the influenza season progressed along the fall migratory routes for wild birds from Siberia across Asia into Europe, large numbers of dead wild birds and outbreaks in poultry flocks were associated with H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group B. Overall, 24 of the 31 the European Union countries, neighboring countries, Israel, and countries in the Middle East were facing large avian influenza outbreaks in poultry or wild birds during that period. Since the end of 2019 HPAI H5N8 outbreaks were reported in Europe in poultry, captive birds, and wild birds.Mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) have been naturally infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtypes H5N1 and H5N8, with similar pathological consequences. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED map of Netherlands: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7891356,67785] See Also

The virulent avian influenza strain of H5N8 was discovered from a fecal sample collected from wild birds on [Wed 21 Oct 2020] in Cheonan, 92 km [approx. 57 mi] south of Seoul, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.The discovery marked the 1st highly pathogenic AI case confirmed in the country since the H5N6 case, which is similarly virulent to H5N8, reported in the nearby Asan region in February 2018.Highly pathogenic AI is very contagious and can make poultry very sick and even cause death.The ministry has already restricted the movement of poultry and other livestock at 188 farms within a 10-km [approx. 6.2 mi] radius of the area after discovering a H5-type AI strain in the area earlier [see comment].Authorities placed a travel ban on people and vehicles within a 500-meter [approx. 0.3 mi] radius of the location where the H5N8 strain was discovered. The purchase and sale of poultry at local markets in Cheonan will also be suspended until the travel ban is lifted.""Given the precarious situation, we ask that all farms remain vigilant in terms of disease control as highly pathogenic AI cases could break out at farms at any given moment,"" a ministry official said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to OIE's terrestrial code, avian influenza is defined as ""an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus of the H5 or H7 subtypes"". The S. Korean authorities have applied immediate preventive measures after the detection of H5N8 influenza A virus in a fecal sample of wild birds (thus non-poultry), even before its high pathogenicity established and serotyping completed. According to the Code, ""Infection with influenza A viruses of high pathogenicity in birds other than poultry, including wild birds, should be notified----""; ""However, a Member Country should not impose bans on the trade in poultry and poultry commodities in response to such a notification"". This relates to international trade, though countries are eligible to maintain more stringent policy intranationally. The measures undertaken in S.Korea by the veterinary authorities are meant to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into poultry farms. The severity of the currently applied policy reflects past experience. During 2014, South Korea suffered a major HPAI H5N8 epizootic, devastating its poultry industry, which was shown to be introduced by migrating birds from China. According to the OIE reports, a total of 212 outbreaks were recorded before declaring the event resolved (in Mar 2015), leading to the culling of nearly 4.7 million birds (see, with map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000017334_20150313_170102.pdf).

During and after the winter of 2016, a related, but genetically distinct, influenza H5N8 virus was detected in Europe; in addition, reassortant influenza H5N5 and H5N6 viruses emerged. Because the influenza season progressed along the fall migratory routes for wild birds from Siberia across Asia into Europe, large numbers of dead wild birds and outbreaks in poultry flocks were associated with H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group B. Overall, 24 of the 31 European Union countries, neighboring countries, Israel, and countries in the Middle East were facing large avian influenza outbreaks in poultry or wild birds during that period. Since the end of 2019, HPAI H5N8 outbreaks were reported in Europe in poultry, captive birds, and wild birds, and Israel confirmed the infection in a Bonelli's eagle (_Aquila fasciata_) found with neurological symptoms in the Jordan Valley.The black swan (_Cygnus atratus_) is a large waterbird, a species of swan that breeds mainly in the southeast and southwest regions of Australia.

The following has been extracted from the OIE Avian Influenza Portal (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza/):Several factors can contribute to the spread of avian influenza viruses, such as:- Globalization and international trade;- Farming and sale (live bird markets);- Wild birds and migratory routes.Wild birds, as natural host and reservoir for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seem to pass easily between different bird species.The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year. Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses' components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:Haifa District, Israel: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7861465,35084] See Also

The eagle had a transmitter, so it could be established that on 1 Jan 2020 it entered the Jordan valley from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and, from then on, stayed in the Jordan valley, on the Israeli side of the Jordan river. The eagle was brought alive to the Wildlife hospital in the Safari of Ramat-Gan and was put there in quarantine, eventually euthanized on 3 Feb 2020. This case was reported to the OIE; see, with map, athttps://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=33117.For the location of the current case, in Kibbutz Metzer (Haifa district), see map at https://tinyurl.com/yxry3znw.Israel is located on main flyways of migrating birds.

The child was hospitalized in August 2020 with mild symptoms and has fully recovered.The investigation into the case shows the girl had contact with domestic poultry. No further cases were confirmed among the contacts of this case.The last case of H9N2 avian influenza was reported in May 2020. In 2020, 6 cases have been reported, all from China.Since 1998, 67 total cases have been reported from 7 countries. In most human cases of H9N2 avian flu, the associated disease symptoms have been mild, and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[H9N2 viruses are avian influenza viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAIV, ""low pathogenic avian influenza virus""), a subtype found worldwide in wild birds while becoming endemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa.Human H9N2 infections are generally mild, and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc). Human H9N2 cases are more often isolated during periods when other HPAI viruses are being surveyed for, such as H7N9 in China and H5N1 in Egypt and Bangladesh. As of June 2019, there have been a total of 59 laboratory confirmed human H9N2 infections with over half of those being recorded since 2015. The majority of those with confirmed infections were young children, and the median age of infection was 4 years (https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/7/620/htm).Recent evidence suggests LPAI H9N2 could potentially have a role in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic, either directly as an H9N2 subtype virus, or through the donation of internal genes to a pandemic virus [Peacock, T., James, J., Sealy, J.

Its wings often go next. Finally, its neck goes limp and it drowns.This is the sad scene that Caroline Brady, a biologist with the California Waterfowl Association, has observed often this summer [2020]. As wildfires burn across the state, temperatures hit record highs, and communities cope with the COVID-19 crisis, she is helping respond to a different disaster: the worst avian botulism outbreak that anyone can remember at the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex.There, thousands of acres of wetland and marsh that should be rich and verdant havens for millions of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds have become a wasteland of dried-up mud ponds strewn with dead ducks, geese, and other victims of avian botulism. Caused by toxin-producing bacteria, the disease -- which is different from the botulism that can infect canned foods -- tends to affect wetlands lacking flowing water that is cool, clean, and aerated. Thanks to drought and limited water deliveries, that's exactly what's missing this summer from much of the refuge.To make a bad situation worse, a wildfire storm stalled the botulism response effort. Because firefighting helicopters were scooping water from the refuge to dump on the nearby Caldwell fire, refuge staff were barred from entering even as the disease began to spread. ""The disease outbreak had 2 weeks to fester before anyone was allowed to go in at all,"" Brady explains.Avian botulism is a regular problem of the Klamath system, which comprises 6 refuges managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. A local wildlife care center handled 494 sick birds in 2018 and 233 last year [2019], according to January Bill, founder of the organization Bird Ally X, which runs the refuge's so-called ""Duck Hospital."" But this summer, between mid-July and early September [2020], her facility had received more than 2750 birds of several dozen species, including mallard, green-winged teal, gadwall, northern pintail, and northern shoveler. ""So, this year is out of control,"" she says.Bill and her team, working in the makeshift field hospital of PVC-framed tents and shallow swimming pools for the birds, have successfully rehabilitated at least 90 percent of their patients and returned them to the wild in botulism-free parts of the refuge. However, the death toll of both waterfowl and shorebirds that don't make it to the facility is soaring off the charts. Field surveyors have collected about 20 000 dead birds, and they guess at least twice that many have perished.""Back in the tule reeds, there are sometimes 10 dead birds all on top of each other,"" says Brady, who has personally collected several thousand birds since July [2020]. Removing the carcasses is important; if left in place, they quickly produce fly larvae which carry the disease and can spread it to other birds that eat the small worms. The disease thrives in warm temperatures, and refuge managers don't expect it to disappear until autumn brings subfreezing nighttime lows.The disaster comes after a dry spring and summer and highlights challenges in sustainably and equitably using the Klamath River's water. Fish, birds, and other wildlife depend on the resource. So do thousands of local farmers, who grow crops like potatoes, horseradish, hay, and barley.To provide water for these users, the US Bureau of Reclamation releases flows from southern Oregon's Upper Klamath Lake, a natural waterway that serves as the basin's major holding pond. The agency also must retain enough water in the lake to support 2 species of endangered suckers. This arrangement, Bureau critics argue, hasn't helped the fish much, and it has many stakeholders feeling shortchanged. In the lower reaches of the watershed, salmon runs have dwindled in part for lack of water, creating dissent among tribal communities and fishing interests. Farmers often want more water, too. In late spring [2020], Klamath Basin growers staged a protest of the Bureau's plans, announced in April, to reduce agricultural allocations.But, as in many river basins in the arid West, the Klamath's water has been overallocated to users, leaving insufficient flows for the basin's aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, which is worsening drought conditions and diminishing the mountain snowpack that feeds the Klamath's tributaries, is likely to aggravate the situation.Amid these challenges, birds are also having a tough time. The Klamath's water allocation system places the basin's refuges last in line to receive flows, which can magnify impacts in dry years like 2020. This summer, the shrinkage of the refuge's wetlands has forced flocks of passing birds to aggregate tightly in warm stagnant water --perfect conditions for a botulism outbreak.To try and stave off disaster, the Bureau of Reclamation in August [2020] released an emergency delivery of 4000 acre-feet of water, following a 4600-acre-foot release in July [2020], according to Mary Lee Knecht, a public affairs officer with the agency. It wasn't enough, though, and as the crisis escalated in early September, the Bureau announced it would release another shot of 5400 acre-feet water for the refuge. Altogether, the releases were but a trifle in the grand scheme of Klamath's water equation. Farmers, for instance, are receiving 147 000 acre-feet this year [2020].At the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Greg Austin, the manager of the Klamath Basin refuge complex, said in an email that he and his agency ""appreciate every drop of water that [the Bureau of] Reclamation can make available."" The water, he explains, will help keep portions of the refuge wet for a few more weeks as they wait for freezing temperatures to halt the disease's life cycle.Meghan Hertel, Audubon California's director of land and water conservation, visited the plague-stricken refuge in late August [2020] when daytime temperatures peaked around 100 deg F [37.8 deg C]. ""It was almost totally dry out there,"" she says. ""There were a few waterholes crammed with birds.""Hertel and colleagues have been advocating for allowing more water onto important bird refuges for years, both here in the Klamath system and farther south, in the San Joaquin Valley, where refuges are chronically shortchanged the water they're supposed to receive. As droughts, heat waves, and a growing human population add extra strain to water-dependent ecosystems like the Klamath Basin's wetlands, Hertel worries that, unless water allocation policies change, crises like the one now affecting the Klamath refuge will recur with greater frequency and intensity.""This die-off should be a wakeup call for all the local stakeholders to sit down and think about how we can get more water out to the refuges,"" she says. ""Putting water out on this landscape is not wasting water.""[Byline: Alastair Bland]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin.Seven immunologically distinct toxins, designated by the letters A to G, are produced by different strains, which are classified into toxinotypes A-G according to the type of toxin produced. Birds (poultry and waterfowl) are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Type C toxin is found in waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial waterbirds, and others; whereas type E toxin in gulls, loons, and others. Types A, B, E, and rarely F, cause human botulism.

Veterinarians from Agriculture Victoria are on the farm in Kerang, 3 hours north of Melbourne, to euthanise the emu chicks.The dramatic move came after 200 birds came down with avian influenza earlier this week, spreading to the emu farm in Kerang and an egg farm in the Golden Plains Shire. The detection of bird flu at the 2 new farms takes the total number of affected farms to 6, since the 1st farm detection on 31 Jul 2020.""The H7N7, H7N6, and H5N2 types of the virus are not a risk to the public as it rarely affects humans unless there is direct and close contact with sick birds. Properly cooked poultry products including chicken and eggs are safe to eat,"" Agriculture Victoria advised.The emu farm is under quarantine. Victoria's chief veterinary officer Dr Graeme Cooke said Agriculture Victoria was acting swiftly to contain the outbreaks. ""The Golden Plains egg farm has been placed under quarantine after being confirmed as having high pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza. It has about 37 000 birds on site within the existing Restricted Area."" Agriculture Victoria has been undertaking regular surveillance at the property as part of its response. ""Agriculture Victoria will undertake the appropriate actions to depopulate and decontaminate the site,"" Dr Cooke said.The emu farm near Kerang reported sick birds to Agriculture Victoria and subsequent testing has confirmed low pathogenic H7N6 avian influenza. The farm, which has around 8000 emus, is under quarantine and authorities have agreed to send the remaining emu eggs to a different farm where they will stay under surveillance and hopefully be born influenza-free. There are hopes the emu eggs can be saved.Agriculture Victoria said the 2 different outbreaks were not linked. ""Thank you to the property owners who notified us quickly when they noticed sick birds,"" Dr Cooke said. ""Avian influenza viruses occur naturally among wild birds and can be difficult to detect as they may not show signs but can cause infections in our domestic bird populations. These detections are a reminder for bird owners to be vigilant: follow restrictions and movement controls for Restricted and Control Areas, monitor your birds' health, and have in place best biosecurity practices at your property.""The 6 farms affected by the disease include 3 in Golden Plains Shire, all confirmed to have high pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza, and 3 with the low pathogenic strain, with 1 in Golden Plains Shire, 1 in Bairnsdale, and the emu farm in Kerang.Bird flu is a highly contagious disease predominantly affecting chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants, and ostriches. While wild birds can typically carry the virus without signs, the disease can occasionally spread to domesticated birds, causing significant death.Agriculture Victoria is calling on locals around the Golden Plains Shire, Kerang, and Bairnsdale to report any sick birds.--communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Victoria now has reported low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 in turkeys in East Gippsland and LPAI H7N6 in an emu farm in Kerang and an egg farm in Golden Plains Shire. High pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 has been diagnosed in 3 egg farms in Golden Plains Shire.With both high and low pathogenic forms of avian influenza in the same state, biosecurity must be at the top of every operations activity.

In a statement today [Wed 26 Aug 2020], Farm Pride confirmed a 2nd farm, a free-range operation housing 40 000 hens, has been affected by the virus, and Agriculture Victoria (Ag Vic) has issued a destruction order to cull all livestock on site. As a result of the outbreaks, the total number of layer (egg-laying) hens lost -- including cage, free range, and barn -- now stands at 380 000, representing about 33% of Farm Pride's productive hen flock.In today's [Wed 26 Aug 2020] statement, Farm Pride said the latest outbreak has occurred ""despite strict monitoring and controls having prohibited the movement of birds, equipment, and products within and out of restricted areas and this farm. It is disappointing, despite the highest biosecurity levels and efforts of the farm management and Ag Vic, that this site has now succumbed to the virus. The AI H7N7 virus is a particularly virulent and aggressive strain."" Farm Pride said it continues to work closely with Agriculture Victoria to ""ensure compliance with all restricted and control area orders"".From 7 Aug [2020], Victoria's chief veterinary officer Dr Graeme Cooke issued a housing of livestock clause for 30 days legally requiring all poultry owners within the state's Golden Plains Shire restricted and control area to keep their birds enclosed. This even includes those with just 2 or 3 chickens or birds.The order came after the H7N7 avian influenza virus was detected at a free-range egg farm near Lethbridge, just outside of Geelong, on 31 Jul [2020], and a 2nd farm was confirmed to have the virus on 6 Aug [2020]. The 2nd farm appears to be Farm Pride's facility, as indicated in its 10 Aug [2020] announcement.In addition, a turkey farm near Bairnsdale in East Gippsland was found to have the low pathogenic strain H5N2 (LPAI) on 10 Aug [2020].""Work is now under way to thoroughly decontaminate all sites to ensure all remnants of the virus are eliminated,"" Ag Vic stated. ""While this is an important milestone as part of eradication efforts, it does not mean the threat is over."" Victoria's health department confirmed the H7N7 and H5N2 strains of bird flu are ""not a risk to the public as they rarely affect humans unless there is direct and close contact with sick birds. There are no food safety issues identified; properly cooked chicken meat and eggs are safe to eat,"" it stated.While there is a level of uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the outbreak and its consequences, the company has forecast a reduction in full-year FY21 net revenue of between AUD 18-23 million [USD 13-16.6 million]. ""Recovery strategies are already being implemented, and the company acknowledges the support of all of its stakeholders, especially our customers and staff,"" it said.

The birds are on a property within an existing restricted area in the Golden Plains.The local government area has had 2 cases of avian flu at 2 free-range egg farms in the last fortnight. Another property at Bairnsdale has also tested positive.Agriculture Victoria has confirmed the H5N2 strain is low pathogenic, but it can affect chickens, ducks, geese, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants and ostriches. Many wild birds can also carry the virus without any signs.The good news for humans is neither the high pathogenic or low pathogenic strains of the virus are a risk, as they rarely affect humans unless there is direct and close contact with sick birds.The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has confirmed workers and biosecurity officers at the affected properties are taking all necessary precautions, including wearing protective personal equipment. There are also no food safety issues identified, as properly cooked poultry meat and eggs are safe to eat.However, if someone has had contact with birds on an affected property and is experiencing cold or flu symptoms, the DHHS advises them to call a doctor or the DHHS for medical advice.Agriculture Victoria said previously experienced incursions of avian influenza viruses have been successfully eradicated.[Byline: Adam Spencer]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Low pathogenic avian influenza can easily mutate to highly pathogenic avian influenza. Measures are being taken to hopefully prevent such an occurrence.

This study describes the spatio‐temporal distribution of HPAI‐H5N1 outbreaks in Vietnam for the period December 2014-April 2018 using the space‐time K‐function and the space‐time scan statistic. The space‐time K‐function analyses showed statistically significant spatio‐temporal clustering of HPAI‐H5N1 outbreaks in poultry during the study period of up to 50 days and 60 km (approx. 37mi). The space‐time scan statistic test identified 3 statistically significant space‐time clusters of HPAI‐H5N1 in the south of the country where the incidence of HPAI‐H5N1 outbreaks was greater than that expected if outbreaks were randomly distributed in space and time. The analyses indicated shortfalls in the effectiveness of control measures used to control HPAI‐H5N1 throughout the study period. Development of a better understanding of the relative impact of HPAI‐H5N1 control measures (depopulation of infected flocks, vaccination, movement restrictions) on space‐time interaction would allow animal health authorities to focus their efforts on control measures shown to have the greatest relative effect"".Reference: Transboundary and Emerging disease, special issue article, ""Spatio‐temporal distribution of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 in Vietnam, 2015- 2018"" Loth L, Pham LT and Stevenson MA, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tbed.13259 (published 10 Jun 2019).- Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map:Trà Vinh Province, Vietnam: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7663163,1042] See Also

Fowl found to have contracted the virus are being euthanized to stop the spread of the disease. [The farm had 43 000 birds and 21 750 cases of avian influenza, according to the immediate notification of the event to OIE; see https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=35259. - Mod.TG]H7N7 is spread from one sick bird to another and mainly affects chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants, ostriches, and wild birds. It can also be passed from animal-to-person and person-to-person if there is direct contact.Symptoms start off like the common flu such as cough, fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, and shortness of breath.Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Graeme Cooke said a 5km [3.1 mi] radius protection zone had been placed around the farm and it is in quarantine. Workers and bio-security officers are managing the situation, he added.'These controls prohibit the movement of birds, related equipment, and products within and out of the designated control area of Golden Plains Shire unless a permit for movement has been granted by Agriculture Victoria until further notice,' he told Geelong Advertiser.'Agriculture Victoria is conducting surveillance throughout the restricted area buffer zone to determine whether the virus is contained to the property or whether it may be active in other areas.'There is currently no risk to any food supplied by the farm.Farmers are being urged to report any suspicious and unexplained bird deaths to the 24-hour Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline, or to their local vet or to Agriculture Victoria animal health staff.There is currently no risk to any food supplied by the farm.[Byline: Jackson Delong]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This has already been confirmed as a highly pathogenic (high path) avian influenza (see the reference to the OIE report above).Biosecurity is not a catch-phrase, it is a serious term used to mean disinfect everything possibly having come into contact with infected material. This includes vehicles, vehicle tires, boots, coveralls, the outside of feed sacks, hands, etc.An outbreak of avian influenza has been confirmed in Victoria. Poultry owners are reminded to have good biosecurity measures in place at all times to reduce the risk of diseases being introduced or spread.If you suspect avian influenza in birds within Queensland, immediately contact 13 25 23 (business hours) or the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888 (after hours).Between 1976 and 1997, 7 outbreaks of HPAI occurred in Australia. HPAI viruses caused clinical disease in commercial poultry in Victoria in 1976 (H7N7), 1985 (H7N7) and 1992 (H7N3), in Queensland in 1994 (H7N3), and in New South Wales in 1997 (H7N4), 2012 (H7N7), and 2013 (H7N2). Each time, there was severe disease in affected chicken flocks. All had obvious or circumstantial evidence of contact with wild waterfowl or surface water contaminated by wild waterfowl, or with free-range farmed ducks. There is some evidence that, initially, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) may have been involved in the outbreaks in 1976, 1992 and 1997 (Selleck et al 2003)(https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/business-priorities/biosecurity/animal-biosecurity-welfare/animal-health-pests-diseases/notifiable/outbreaks)The information below was extracted from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment page on avian influenza, available at https://www.agriculture.gov.au/pests-diseases-weeds/animal/avian-influenza#what-is-australia-doing-about-avian-influenza (last updated 4 Nov 2019).""Australia is well prepared to deal with a case of avian influenza should it occur in poultry here. There have been 7 minor incidents of highly pathogenic avian influenza (all involving types of avian influenza that have not caused disease in humans) in Australia, the last being in 2013.

From January to December 2019, 9 outbreaks of HPAI H5N6 were reported. For additional details on the outbreaks, see Viet Nam's OIE 6-monthly report Jan to Jun 2019 at https://tinyurl.com/v5llnds, and OIE 6-monthly report  Jul to Dec 2019 at https://tinyurl.com/ybp96v2c , section 3 of these reports.""Avian Influenza outbreaks can lead to devastating consequences for the poultry industry as well as at national level. Experience has shown that:- Farmers might experience a high level of mortality in their flocks, with rates often around 50%;- Due to the labor intensive nature of the poultry industry, especially in developing countries, job losses can be significant;- To contain outbreaks, healthy birds often need to be culled, resulting in risks to animal and human welfare, and concerns regarding protein wastage and economic impacts;- The presence of HPAI restricts international trade in live birds and poultry meat;- Public opinion may be damaged, reducing both travel and tourism in affected areas.People who are in close contact with infected birds are at risk for acquiring avian influenza. While many human cases are limited to conjunctivitis or mild respiratory disease, some viruses tend to cause severe illness. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the consumption of poultry or eggs fit for human consumption could transmit the AI virus to humans.As a precautionary and regulatory measure, animals that have been culled as a result of measures to control an AI outbreak should not be allowed to enter the human food and animal feed chain, and precautionary measures for the cleaning and cooking process should be respected"".

The RSPCA and Canal & River trust have been called out on several occasions to remove the birds, and it has now been determined that the birds most likely died of avian botulism.A Canal & River Trust spokesperson said:""Unfortunately, several dead geese were found on the Ashton Canal over the weekend. Our team attended the site to investigate the cause of the incident. It appears that there has been a suspected outbreak of avian botulism, which is a naturally occurring bacterial infection that can affect wildfowl in the water and is more common in the summer with warm conditions.""We've notified DEFRA of the incident and supported them with their investigation. The dead geese have now been removed, and we will continue to monitor the situation. We would like to thank the public for making us aware.""The RSPCA reported on Twitter that they had rescued 3 sick geese and retrieved 2 dead ones from the canal on Monday [29 Jun 2020].Unfortunately, avian botulism tends to affect large numbers of birds at once, and infections can stick around for a long time. This means we may see more birds affected by the disease in Manchester, including other species. Dead birds can be reported to DEFRA on 0345 933 5577, and any sick birds should be reported to the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999. Sick birds may be moving strangely or struggling to move, as the disease causes paralysis.Waterfowl can catch this disease from botulinum toxin in the water, and from eating maggots or any part of a dead infected bird. There is a very low risk to humans, although the public should refrain from touching the birds and practice normal hand hygiene. There is also a low risk to pets, so it is advisable to keep dogs out of the water and keep dogs on leads near alive and dead birds.[Byline: Katy Preen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and, to a lesser extent, type E. - Mod.PMBHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:England, United Kingdom: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7534053,279] See Also

The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds, however the virus seem to pass easily between different bird species.The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year.Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans.""Source: OIE Avian Influenza Portal https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map of India: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7424094,142] See Also

H9N2 viruses are the cause of significant production losses and mortalities in poultry production systems and are endemic in several countries in Africa and Asia.Human H9N2 infections are generally mild, and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc). Human H9N2 cases are more often isolated during periods where other HPAI viruses are being surveyed for, such as H7N9 in China and H5N1 in Egypt and Bangladesh. As of June 2019, there have been a total of 59 laboratory-confirmed human H9N2 infections, with over half of those being recorded since 2015. The majority of those with confirmed infections were young children, and the median age of infection was 4 years (https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/7/620/htm).It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people be fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:Fujian, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7392699,66792Shandong Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7392699,349] See Also

USD 3 million], he said.Facilities operating in line with the relevant regulations are eligible for damages from the state, Bognar said, adding that many have been found to flout a January [2020?] decree to keep the animals in closed facilities at all times.Bognar noted that bird flu was typically brought into the country by migratory birds, hence the ban on open-air poultry farming.H5N8 1st appeared in Asia in 2014, when it developed into a pandemic. It last appeared in Hungary in 2016-2017.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[HPAI H5N8 has been reported, since early 2020, from 4 European countries, namely Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Poland. Ongoing outbreaks are still present in Germany, Hungary and Poland, in poultry and/or non-poultry birds.Hungary's main outbreak started 22 Mar 2020, affecting poultry farms in the southern province Bacs-Kiskun bordering Serbia. The most recent follow-up report, No. 4, reporting 53 new outbreaks, was submitted to the OIE on 21 Apr 2020 and is available, with map, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=34083.To view all Europe's HPAI H5N8 outbreaks since the start of 2020, please visit OIE interactive global map of HPAI at https://tinyurl.com/ychmty84 (click on the European/Hungary cluster, zoom in to the required resolution).EU member countries are obliged to apply stamping-out policy in relation to HPAI H5N8; no vaccine is allowed. Though HAPI H5N8 has not been found, so far, to cause human disease, this aspect requires continuous attention/followup to prevent surprises.

This is the 1st confirmed case of HPAI in commercial poultry in the United States since 2017. It appears this HPAI strain mutated from a low pathogenic strain that has been found in poultry in that area recently.No human cases of this H7N3 avian influenza virus have been detected, and there is no immediate public health concern. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F kills bacteria and viruses.Samples from the affected flock, which experienced increased mortality, were tested at the Clemson Veterinary Diagnostic Center, part of the National Animal Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.  Virus isolation is ongoing.APHIS is working closely with the South Carolina State Veterinarian's Office, part of Clemson University, on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property were depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in the nearby area. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.USDA will report this finding to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. All bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, should continue to practice good biosecurity, prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Additional information on biosecurity can be found at <www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/defendtheflock>.Additional background:Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin, or ""H"" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or ""N"" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of ""H"" and ""N"" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), which is the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.--Communicated by:Mary Marshall<mjm2020@googlemail.com>andMo Salman<mo.salman@colostate.edu>[Avian Influenza (AI) is primarily an infection of birds. It is a highly infectious viral disease, classified according to its severity, with 2 recognized forms: HPAI, highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as fowl plague, and low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI). AI viruses causing HPAI are highly virulent, and infected domestic flocks can experience high morbidity and mortality rates up to 100%. HPAI remains a high-priority concern for USDA APHIS as outbreaks have occurred in 2014-2015 (largest animal disease outbreak), 2016, and 2017. Most AI viruses are LPAI viruses and do not result in high mortality in wild birds or domestic poultry; however, strain mutation or reassortment to an HPAI virus can occur (through antigenic shift or antigenic drift). AI viruses are a significant concern to public health, such as H5N1, H5N6, and the Asian lineage H7N9. Human infection is generally uncommon, but fatalities have occurred after infection by certain strains.Many avian species are susceptible to infection with HPAI viruses, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, guinea fowl, and a wide variety of other birds, such as migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Psittacine birds, such as parrots and cockatiels, are rarely affected. Mammalian hosts, including humans, may be vulnerable to infection by some AI strains, including HPAI H5 and HPAI H7subtypes.AI viruses usually infect migratory waterfowl, particularly Anseriformes (ducks and geese) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds) that can carry LPAI viruses without showing illness. The wild bird reservoir of LPAI viruses is considered a major potential source of infection for domestic birds, particularly free- and open-range poultry. Following transmission from wild to commercial birds, the virus can mutate or reassort in gallinaceous poultry flocks, resulting in an HPAI virus.The following are examples of how HPAI can be transmitted:- Animal-to-animal contact: HPAI is usually transmitted via direct exposure to HPAI-infected birds, feces, or secretions from infected birds. When a hen is infected, the HPAI virus is also likely to be present on the eggshell and internal egg contents; however, to date there is no evidence demonstrating vertical transmission of the virus.- Fomites: HPAI is easily transmitted by objects and may persist on an item for an extended period of time. For example, people, contaminated clothing, equipment, and vehicles can easily carry the virus.- Wildlife: Contact with infected wild birds or their secretions, particularly wild waterfowl, is the most likely mode of introduction of AI into a poultry population.- Airborne: Airborne transmission of HPAI is not likely a primary mode of transmission, although it may occur over short distances as an aerosol via contaminated dust. Incubation periods are variable; HPAI may be longer and differ per subtype. Typically, the incubation period in naturally infected chickens ranges from 3-14 days. The OIE recognizes the incubation period as 21 days.Birds affected with HPAI show a variety of clinical signs involving the respiratory, digestive, reproductive, or nervous systems. Signs of LPAI are typically much milder. Appearance of clinical signs vary; domestic ducks and wild birds may not show clinical signs.HPAI often causes morbidity and mortality rates in domestic poultry of between 90 and100%. Clinical signs in poultry commonly include marked depression with ruffled feathers, droopiness, soft-shelled eggs, sudden drop in egg production, loss of appetite, excessive thirst, swollen wattles and combs, diarrhea, incoordination, respiratory distress, and increased daily mortality.https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergency_management/downloads/rrg_hpai_ee.pdfPlease visit the above listed website regarding specific disinfectants and the specifics around each kind of list. - Mod.TGHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:Chesterfield County, South Carolina, United States: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7206731,60348] See Also

The case is a 3-year-old female from Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, who had a history of environmental exposure to domestic poultry before the onset of symptoms. She had mild illness and no symptoms have been detected in her contacts.In 2020, there are 3 cases reported so far, 2 from China and one from India. A total of 30 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015.--Communicated by:Michael Fraser<frasermdx@gmail.com>[This is the 3rd human case of avian influenza A/H9N2 reported from China in 2020, with earlier cases reported from Hong Kong SAR and India.H9N2 viruses are avian influenza viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAIV, ""low pathogenic avian influenza virus""), a subtype found worldwide in wild birds while becoming endemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa.Human H9N2 infections are generally mild and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc). Human H9N2 cases are more often isolated during periods where other HPAI viruses are being surveyed for, such as H7N9 in China and H5N1 in Egypt and Bangladesh. As of June 2019, there have been a total of 59 laboratory-confirmed human H9N2 infections with over half of those being recorded since 2015. The majority of those with confirmed infections were young children and the median age of infection was 4 years (https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/7/620/htm).It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people be fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories.WHO guidelines, entitled ""Protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases"", are available at https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275657/WHO-WHE-IHM-GIP-2018.2-eng.pdf. - Mod.UBA][LPAI H9N2 viruses are found worldwide in wild birds while becoming endemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa. In distinction to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, they are not OIE-notifiable. Consequently, infected countries are not liable to OIE's restrictive requirements for international trade. Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2, many countries, including China, have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry. The most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines.Recent evidence, summarised in Ref 1, suggests LPAI H9N2 could potentially have a role in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic, either directly as an H9N2 subtype virus, or through the donation of internal genes to a pandemic virus.Ref. 1: Peacock, T., James, J., Sealy, J.

Scientific report: avian influenza overview November 2019 - February 2020. EFSA Journal 2020;18(3):6096, 54 pp. doi: 10.2903/j.efsa.2020.6096. See full report at https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2020.6096.Abstract--------""Between 16 Nov 2019 and 15 Feb 2020, 36 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N8) virus outbreaks were reported in Europe in poultry (n=34), captive birds (n=1) and wild birds (n=2), in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Germany, Czechia and Ukraine; one HPAI outbreak caused by a simultaneous infection with A(H5N2) and A(H5N8) was reported in poultry in Bulgaria, and 2 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5) virus outbreaks were reported in poultry in the United Kingdom and in Denmark. Genomic characterisation of the HPAI A(H5N8) viruses suggests that they are reassortants of HPAI A(H5N8) viruses from Africa and LPAI viruses from Eurasia. It is likely that this reassortment occurred in wild migratory birds in Asia during the summer and then spread to eastern Europe with the autumn migration. This is the 1st time that wild bird migration from Africa to Eurasia has been implicated in the long-distance spread of HPAI viruses to the EU. Given the late incursion of HPAI A(H5N8) virus into the EU in this winter season (1st outbreak reported on 30 Dec 2019), its overall restriction to eastern Europe, and the approaching spring migration, the risk of the virus spreading further in the west via wild birds is decreasing for the coming months. Genetic analysis of the HPAI A(H5N2) and A(H5N8) viruses detected in the Bulgarian outbreak reveals that these viruses are both related to the 2018-19 Bulgarian HPAI A(H5N8) viruses and not to the HPAI A(H5N8) viruses currently circulating in Europe. An increasing number of HPAI A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N5) and A(H5N6) virus outbreaks in poultry in Asia were reported during the time period for this report compared with the previous reporting period. Single outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N8) virus were notified by Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Furthermore, in contrast to the last report, HPAI virus-positive wild birds were reported from Israel and one of the key migration areas in northern China. Two human cases due to A(H9N2) virus infection were reported during the reporting period."" - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map available at:Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7168460,101] See Also

The affected premises is a large turkey breeder farm with 10 579 birds. Of these, 130 were reported to have died from disease, and the remaining birds were culled. Following an outbreak in a backyard poultry holding on 12 Mar 2020 in Leipzig, a wild bird case, in a common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_), was reported in the same area (see map at the source URL above) on 21 Mar 2020.Bulgaria, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine have reported no new outbreaks since our last update on 16 Mar 2020.Conclusion-----------The OIE/FAO international reference laboratory/UK national laboratory at Weybridge [UK] has the necessary ongoing diagnostic capability for these strains of virus, whether low or high pathogenicity AI, and continually monitors changes in the virus.Although an outbreak of HPAI H5N8 has occurred in poultry in north-western Germany near to the eastern border of the Netherlands, there are no more reports of cases in wild birds near to the UK. The H5N8-positive common buzzard was located in eastern Germany where H5N8 has recently been reported in poultry. The detection of HPAI in poultry in Germany, particularly along the north-coast so near to the Netherlands, would be of great concern to the UK were it to occur in the autumn months, when wildfowl are migrating westwards to the UK. However at this time of year in late March, with the start of the migration of wild ducks, geese, and swans away from their wintering sites in the UK to their breeding grounds in northern Europe/Russia, the risk of HPAI incursion in wild birds in the UK should be decreasing and is therefore still considered to be LOW (that is, no change at present). We are monitoring this very closely.The overall risk for poultry in the UK remains low, but the risk of introduction to individual premises depends upon the level of biosecurity implemented on the farms to prevent direct or indirect contact with wild birds. It should be noted that the virus could potentially survive on pasture in wild bird faeces for several weeks at ambient temperatures in late March, emphasising the importance of these measures. We recommend biosecurity measures should be maintained. We are keeping this under review.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[While UK retains its 'country free' status for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), with no confirmed cases since June 2017, low pathogenic (thus non-notifiable) strains of the virus have been recently reported from poultry and wild birds. According to a media report dated 24 Mar 2020, a total of 16 such cases are believed to have been confirmed by authorities in Northern Ireland (12), Scotland (2), and England (1; see https://www.farminguk.com/news/16-cases-of-bird-flu-confirmed-in-uk-so-far-this-year_55277.html). The virus strain involved, in all said cases, was LPAI H6N1.In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) detected the presence of a strain of low pathogenic avian influenza, subtype H6N1, at 12 premises.One of those affected was Ready Egg Products, which culled all 375 000 enriched cage birds on the site involved. The low pathogenic virus is not notifiable and, as such, there is no requirement by the authorities to cull birds. However, Ready Egg took the decision unilaterally to remove the birds.A similar strain was confirmed in Scotland -- at a site run by Glenrath Farms. A Scottish government spokesperson said there had been other cases.""There have been 2 businesses within Scotland, where we have identified non-notifiable strains of avian influenza,"" he said. ""These are mild strains and do not require government intervention. Precautionary restrictions were put in place as part of our routine investigations. These have now been lifted.""He added: ""We would continue to encourage bird keepers to maintain high levels of bio-security and follow advice. Anyone who suspects a notifiable avian disease must report it immediately to their local animal and plant health agency.""The Scottish government said that avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds. It could infect people but does not do this easily.""The risk of humans catching avian influenza is extremely low. Any bird keepers who may have concerns should immediately seek veterinary advice,"" he said.Defra has confirmed just one case of low path AI in England.""The UK retains its country free status for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), with no confirmed cases since June 2017,"" said a spokesman. ""APHA regularly respond to suspect cases of notifiable avian disease. Notifiable avian disease has been ruled out in all of these since December 2019, but there has been one case of non-notifiable avian influenza identified in England.""The spokesman said that bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises.An exceptional case of human infection by LPAI H6N1 strain was reported from Taiwan in 2013; see, including Mod.CP's comment, in 20131114.2055317. The case was addressed in a 2015 paper available a http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312815000621 (details in 20150315.3232207). - Mod.AS] See Also

The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species. The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year. Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans.""

These were the 1st reports of human infections with A(H9N2) viruses from these countries. The 3 other new cases were reported by China (2) and Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China (1) and were from the Y280/G9 lineage. All cases recovered.Highlighting Senegal's 1st H9N2 human case with strain designation A/Senegal/0243/2019--Communicated by:Michael Fraser RN(CNO)<frasermdx@gmail.com>[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Senegal: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7059887,48H9N2 viruses are avian influenza of low pathogenicity (LPAIV, ""low pathogenic avian influenza virus""), a subtype found worldwide in wild birds while becoming endemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa. Compared to H5 and H7 viruses, of which many are of high pathogenicity in poultry (HPAIV), they are somewhat neglected. This is partially the outcome of LPAIV strains, such as H9N2, being -- in difference with HPAIV viruses -- pathogens which are not OIE notifiable, causing relatively few overt human infections though significant economic losses.In many resource-limited regions surveillance is performed sporadically, or not at all. It is likely that H9N2 viruses are present, or endemic, in more countries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia; Senegal seems to be a recent example. A map presenting the distribution of the virus in Eurasia and Africa, as of June 2019, is available in ref 1 below.H9N2 viruses are fairly regularly isolated from humans. The 1st reported human cases involved 2 children, in Hong Kong in 1999, who exhibited flu-like symptoms. Retrospectively, several H9N2 infections had occurred in mainland China during 1998. Subsequent human infections have been reported from Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Oman, now followed by India and Senegal.Human H9N2 infections are generally mild and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc). Human H9N2 cases are more often isolated during periods where other HPAI viruses are being surveyed for, such as H7N9 in China and H5N1 in Egypt and Bangladesh. As of June 2019, there have been a total of 59 laboratory-confirmed human H9N2 infections with over half of those being recorded since 2015 (see Table 2, Figure 2a in ref 1 below). The majority of those with confirmed infections were young children and the median age of infection was 4-years-old.Recent evidence, summarised in ref 1 below, suggests LPAI H9N2 could potentially have a major role in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic, either directly as an H9N2 subtype virus, or through the donation of internal genes to a pandemic virus. Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2, many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry. The most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines.The human case in Senegal, a country in which hitherto H9N2 in poultry has not been reported, is an important development and further information on the epidemiological situation of the case, specifically about outbreaks in poultry in the region, would be highly appreciated.References----------1.

The outbreak is located in the farm of Moras Moravany in the village of Slepotice [map at https://tinyurl.com/ul3koqz] in the Pardubicky region. The affected farm has both turkeys (7500 heads) as well as approximately 130 000 broiler chickens. Measures include a 3km [approx. 1.8mi] protection zone and a 10km [approx. 6.2mi] surveillance zone.The breeder on [Sun 16 Feb 2020] reported increased mortality in the breeding of 7500 turkeys, 1300 of which died within 3 days from [Fri 14 Feb to Sun 16 Feb 2020]. In addition, dying poultry showed symptoms suggesting that it could be bird flu. Official veterinarians immediately took samples of dead poultry for testing on the spot and took measures to prevent the possible spread of dangerous outbreaks. An examination of the dead animals carried out at the State Veterinary Institute in Prague this morning [Mon 17 Feb 2020] confirmed that it is a highly pathogenic subtype of avian influenza H5N8. There are also some 130 000 broiler chickens on the farm.""The entire premises of the company were closed immediately; a disinfection loop will be installed at the entrance to prevent the disease from spreading outside the premises. This evening or tomorrow morning, veterinarians will cull all the [remaining turkeys], which will then be safely disposed of in the sanitation plant"", said Minister of Agriculture Miroslav Toman.The remaining poultry on the holding will be killed and further measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. ""As in the case of the 1st outbreak, located in Stepanov nad Svratkou in the Vysocina Region, a 3km [approx. 1.8 mi] protection zone and a 10km [approx. 6.2mi] surveillance zone will be set out. They shall restrict the movement of poultry, farms shall be kept and other emergency veterinary measures taken. At the same time, the investigation is continuing, the main aim of which is to find out how the infection got into the breeding"", said the central director of the State Veterinary Administration Zbynek Semerad.Due to the favorable disease situation around the outbreak in the Highlands and the 30-day deadline since its announcement, today [Mon 17 Feb 2020] the announcement on the relevant official boards will end the extraordinary veterinary measures for closed zones around the outbreak in Stepanov nad Svratkou.Avian influenza viruses are commonly found in wild birds and are transmitted mainly through droppings. Therefore, infection is most often caused by the ingestion of feed or water contaminated with faeces of infected birds. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses cause high morbidity and mortality in birds. In poultry farming, they cause significant direct and indirect economic losses.Breeders are legally guaranteed compensation for euthanized animals and the MoA also reimburses them for all purposefully spent costs resulting from measures ordered on the spot. Applications for refunds must be made within 6 weeks of the culling. All information is available on the website of the Ministry, where there are contacts to relevant [Ministry's] workers who will help farmers if necessary.[Byline: Vojtech Bily, and Petr Majer]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The Czech media website ceskenoviny reported today 17 Feb 2020 late afternoon, that the causative agent of the event is HPAI H5N8. The culling activities, starting tonight, are to continue until Fri 20 Feb 2020. The damage is estimated by the company to be 10 million crowns (USD 436 248) https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/na-pardubicku-je-ptaci-chripka-vybijeni-drubeze-zacne-dnes-vecer/1855312 [in Czech].From late December 2019 to date, 17 Feb 2020, HPAI H5N8 has been reported in wild birds and small poultry holdings in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Israel. In difference with earlier outbreaks, the current event affected a commercial enterprise. Farmers in Europe have been alerted to take adequate measures against exposure of their animals to wild birds, in particular during the migration season.

The Philippines has also reported H5N6 in poultry. The virus is highly pathogenic in birds and has been isolated from both poultry and wild birds.""In April 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) 1st reported a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) from China. As of 24 Dec 2019, a total of 24 human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported from 10 different provinces across mainland China. Four of these cases were in children, 2 of whom had only mild illness. Of the remaining 20 adult cases, all had a severe illness and at least 15 were fatal.""The majority of human cases of HPAI A(H5N6) in mainland China are known to have had contact with birds or their environments or exposure to suspected contaminated meat prior to becoming ill, and there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission. WHO considers that the H5 avian influenza viruses have not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans and therefore the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is low at present"".

The boy was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital's isolation ward. The Centre for Health Protection on Friday [7 Feb 2020] confirmed that the boy's nasal swab tested positive for the strain of avian flu, with the subtype still to be determined. The boy had recently returned to the city from mainland China.The centre said the boy had underlying illnesses and developed a cough and runny nose on Tuesday [4 Feb 2020], which turned to a fever on Wednesday [5 Feb 2020]. He went for treatment at the outpatient ward at the Wang Tau Hom Jockey Club Clinic and was transferred to an isolation ward at Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei for further medical care. He was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital's isolation ward on Thursday [6 Feb 2020], where his condition was stable.According to the centre's preliminary investigations, the patient had visited his grandparents' home in Shenzhen at the incubation stage of his viral infection. Although the family kept poultry in their house, the boy had not come into direct contact with the birds. His family members have not reported any symptoms.A Department of Health spokesperson said investigations were underway and the relevant medical staff at the clinic, ambulance and hospitals, as well as any possibly affected patients, had been placed under medical observation.H9 is a seasonal influenza that is required by law to be reported to the city's health authorities. Hong Kong has in total recorded 8 H9N2 infections, the most recent an imported case in 2013. The virus is a relatively mild type of avian flu, and no local deaths have been recorded.Hong Kong is also battling a strain of coronavirus that originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. The flulike virus -- contracted by 31 500 people worldwide, mostly in the province -- has infected 26 people in the city, killing one.Dr Joseph Tsang Kay-yan, a private specialist in infectious disease, said he believed the boy was an isolated case. ""If we see similar cases or many local birds dying of unknown causes, then that would warrant further concern,"" Tsang said.[byline: Victor Ting]--communicated by:Mary Marshall<mjm2020@googlemail.com>******[2]Date: Fri 7 Feb 2020Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]http://outbreaknewstoday.com/hong-kong-imported-h9-influenza-case-coronavirus-update-92598/Hong Kong health officials reported an imported case of influenza A (H9) infection today [7 Feb 2020].The patient, a 7 year old boy with underlying illnesses, developed a cough and runny nose on 4 Feb 2020 and fever on the next day. On 5 Feb 2020, he was brought to Wang Tau Hom Jockey Club General Outpatient Clinic (GOPC) for medical advice and was transferred to Kwong Wah Hospital (KWH), where he was admitted to the isolation ward for further management. He was transferred to the general ward of KWH yesterday [6 Feb 2020] and then was transferred to the isolation ward of Princess Margaret Hospital for treatment today [7 Feb 2020]. He has been in stable condition.His nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for the influenza A (H9) virus upon testing. Subtyping result is pending. His clinical diagnosis was avian influenza.Preliminary investigation by the CHP [Centre for Health Protection] revealed that the patient visited his maternal grandparents' home in Shenzhen during the incubation period, where backyard poultry was kept. However, the patient had no direct poultry contact recently, nor consumption of undercooked poultry or contact with patients. His home contacts have remained asymptomatic so far.Novel influenza A infection, including influenza A(H9), is a notifiable infectious disease in Hong Kong. Eight cases of influenza A (H9N2) have been reported in the past, including 2 local cases in 1999, one local case each in 2003 and 2007, an imported case in 2008, an imported case and one with the source of infection unclassified in 2009, and one imported case in 2013. No deaths have been recorded so far. Influenza A (H9N2) infection is a mild form of avian influenza.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As mentioned in the above report, A/H9 influenza is essentially an avian virus and not seasonal or human.There are 9 known subtypes of H9 viruses (H9N1, H9N2, H9N3, H9N4, H9N5, H9N6, H9N7, H9N8, and H9N9); all H9 viruses identified worldwide in wild birds and poultry are LPAI viruses. H9N2 virus has been detected in bird populations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Rare, sporadic H9N2 virus infections in people have been reported to generally cause mild upper respiratory tract illness; one infection has resulted in death (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/influenza-a-virus-subtypes.htm).It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories.WHO guidelines, entitled ""Protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases"", are available at https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275657/WHO-WHE-IHM-GIP-2018.2-eng.pdf.Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, member states are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses. - Mod.UBAHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Hong Kong: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6967624,198.] See Also

The statement said the outbreak was of a ""highly pathogenic subtype"" of the H5N1 flu.Since 2003, the H5N1 avian flu has killed 455 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.[Byline: Emma Dong]--Communicated by:Mary Marshall <mjm2020@googlemail.com>[Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual.Unfortunately, the newly emerged coronavirus behind the current pandemic, namely 2019nCoV, does cause person-to-person infection. Its animal reservoir animals are likely to be bats; in case an intermediate animal was/is involved in delivering a bat-borne pathogen to humans, its identity has not yet been discovered. If/when discovered, its discovery should be immediately reported to the OIE under the title ""emerging disease.""HPAI H5N1, similar to other bird-borne pathogens, is seasonal. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED map available at:Hunan Province, China: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6945785,341] See Also

Because of the lower numbers of H5 HPAI outbreaks observed in 2018/2019, there may now be more limited immunity in the naive wild bird population to H5 viruses, with a large susceptible population of hosts in the form of juvenile birds migrating to the UK every autumn. The experts recommended that all poultry keepers stay vigilant and make themselves aware of the latest information on <www.gov.uk>, particularly about recommendations for biosecurity and how to register their flocks.ProMED-mail apologizes for the delayed publication of Professor Brown's response. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:Northern Ireland: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6913195,197] See Also

The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species.The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year. Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor. Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans.""Source: https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/web-portal-on-avian-influenza/about-ai/. - Mod.CRDHealthMap/ProMED map available at:Poland: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6907496,113] See Also

The outbreak affects a small poultry farm in Stepanov nad Svratkou, in the Vysocina Region. The virus was introduced by wild water birds. It is a highly pathogenic subtype of H5N8 virus, fatal to birds, but transmission to humans has not yet been reported.The infected stock were 12 hens, 6 of which died within 2 days, and there were 3 ducks. Veterinary inspectors started their investigation and took precautionary measures immediately after the reporting by the breeder about the poultry deaths, and sent dead hens for examination to the State Veterinary Institute in Prague. The latter confirmed the highly pathogenic avian influenza in all 6 animals.""My colleagues at the Ministry are ready to help affected farmers with compensation that they are legally entitled to. But most important now is to prevent further spread of infection, in particular by preventing contact between wild and domestic birds,"" said Minister of Agriculture Miroslav Toman.""The remaining poultry on the farm will be euthanized; a 3-km [1.9 mi] protection zone and a surveillance zone of 10 km [6.2 mi] radius will be defined, and extraordinary veterinary measures will be declared there,"" said Zbynek Semerad, the Central Director of the State Veterinary Administration.Emergency veterinary measures will restrict the movement of poultry to and from the zones and ban exhibitions or stock exchanges of poultry and birds that pose a high risk of spreading disease.[Byline: Petr Vorlicek, SVA Press Spokesman]--Communicated by:Mary Marshall <mjm2020@googlemail.com>[The above event, located centrally in the Czech Republic (map at https://tinyurl.com/up2xcmj), brings the number of European countries affected by HPAI H5N8 since late 2019 to 5. The others are Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. Most of the H5N8 HPAI events involve domestic poultry.The last reported H5N8 HPAI outbreaks date back to April 2019 in Bulgaria, and no evidence of H5N8 HPAI infection in wild birds or poultry had been reported from the region since.According to a recent FAO circular: ""The epidemiological information and pattern of these recent H5N8 HPAI outbreaks suggest a likely role for wild birds in the dissemination of the virus across parts of Eastern Europe. Investigation of the Slovakia outbreak, which occurred in a backyard flock with no links to commercial poultry farms, strongly supports this hypothesis. Eastern Europe experienced unusual mild temperatures during the months of November and December 2019, with limited snow coverage. Consequently, wild birds in Europe may not have pursued their usual patterns of southwards movement, crossing the Mediterranean Basin.European countries located at lower latitudes and short distances from the current outbreaks and with significant poultry production may be at higher risk for disease introduction over the coming months, depending on wild bird movements. In addition, poultry trade remains a major risk factor for disease spread amongst countries. Current regulatory frameworks in Europe with regards to poultry flock testing and poultry movement controls at country borders should be strictly enforced to mitigate this risk.Genetic information on these H5N8 HPAI viruses is not yet publicly available. Information shared with FAO by the FAO/EU Reference Laboratory Avian Influenza in Padova, Italy (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie - IZSVe) indicates the current European viruses have close genetic identity (99.8-100% genetic similarity) and are related to clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses detected in Africa in 2018-19. Further investigations are continuing."" - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED map available at:Vysocina, Vysočina, Czech Republic: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6897846,51685] See Also

It is Hungary's 2nd outbreak this year (2020); the previous one, earlier this week, was located in the north-west, facing Slovakia (see 20200113.6887610).Eastern Europe is experiencing an upsurge of H5N8 HPAI outbreaks with 4 countries affected so far (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania). Most of the H5N8 HPAI events involve domestic poultry. Wild birds are likely to be the primary source for at least some of these outbreaks, as it was observed in the past for H5N8 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b virus during the 2016/2017 wave.The last reported H5N8 HPAI outbreaks date back to April 2019 in Bulgaria and no evidence of H5N8 HPAI infection in wild birds or poultry had been reported from the region since.Countries should share the genetic information collected on H5N8 viruses with the international community to better assess the introduction and spread of the virus throughout Europe. Surveillance for avian influenza in dead or hunted wild birds should be implemented or enhanced during the coming months. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Hungary: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6892603,65280] See Also

In 2019, the reported number of infections decreased drastically.New introductions of HPAI H5N8, affecting poultry, have been recently reported from Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary, attributed to the virus being transmitted from wild migratory birds.The causative pathogenic agent which may have caused a recent suspected disease event affecting broilers in Northern Ireland has not yet become available (see 20200108.6877259). - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Romania: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6890556,65279] See Also

It was discovered 4 days ago [4 Jan 2020] when a vet became concerned about increased mortality among the broiler birds.Tests are being run to see if it is bird flu or another disease called Newcastle disease. It will be several days before final results are back. Restrictions have been put in place on the farm as a precautionary measure.The Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairs can order the culling of birds to prevent disease spreading. Farmers have been urged to step up their biosecurity.The disease risk increases in winter with the arrival of migratory birds which can carry them. In recent years bird flu has been confirmed in wild birds on several occasions.Last month [December 2019], the H5 strain of bird flu was detected at a commercial poultry business in Suffolk; 27 000 chickens were culled there [see commentary].Poultry is an important part of the Northern Ireland agri-food sector. The latest figures show there are about 26 million birds on farms here. The majority of them are bred for meat, but there are a substantial number of laying hens too. Annual turnover from poultry is about GBP 709 million (USD 928 million) and it employs almost 6000 people.[Byline: Conor Macauley]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Tue 7 Jan 2020Source: Carlow Live [edited]https://www.carlowlive.ie/news/news/506642/carlow-farmers-bird-flu-alert-after-suspected-outbreak-at-a-poultry-farm-in-ireland.htmlFarmers across Ireland have been warned to step up biosecurity measures as a suspected outbreak of bird flu is being investigated at a poultry farm in Fermanagh. A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in Northern Ireland said that officials are investigating the suspected presence of a ""notifiable avian disease"" (NAD) in a broiler breeder flock in Fermanagh.A private veterinary practitioner contacted DAERA on [2 Jan 2020] with concerns over increased bird mortality at the premises. The DAERA spokesperson said a veterinary enquiry at the holding started that evening. Testing has already started on samples taken from birds to detect the presence of serious bird diseases like avian influenza and Newcastle disease. The results are expected to take several days, and restrictive measures are in place on the farm.The spokesperson added: ""All bird keepers are urged to remain vigilant, and if they suspect any signs of the disease in their flocks, they must report it immediately to DAERA.""All poultry keepers, including backyard flock keepers and those keeping game birds and pet birds, need to act now and maintain high levels of biosecurity at all times in order to reduce the risk of transmission of avian flu to their flocks.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Last month's (December 2019) H5 outbreak in Suffolk, mentioned in section [1] above, was caused by a low-pathogenic H5N3 virus strain. The relevant veterinary inquiry, followed by culling and other control measures, was undertaken following reports of a drop in egg production. Reportedly, the cleansing and disinfection activities were completed and effective as of 18 Dec 2019 (see OIE follow-up report no. 2 at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=32776).The results of the laboratory tests of the current event in Northern Ireland, as well as of the epidemiological investigation, are anticipated.Two H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtypes have been circulating in Europe in recent years, namely, H5N8 and (a European reassortant strain of the H5N6 HPAI virus) H5N6. Their circulation was observed mainly during the relevant season (December through March), synchronic with decreasing temperatures and wild bird migration movements.H5N8 HPAI was 1st introduced into Eastern Europe in mid-October 2016; it has been detected in 30 of 43 European countries, particularly in Western and Eastern Europe. In 2019, the reported number of infections decreased drastically, and the disease affected mainly domestic poultry in Bulgaria and the Russian Federation. HPAI H5N8 has recently been reported from Poland.The last report of the H5N6 HPAI strain occurred in Denmark in January 2019. - Mod.ASHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:Northern Ireland: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6877259,197] See Also
